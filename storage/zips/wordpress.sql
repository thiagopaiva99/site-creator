This year is no exception, as <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/wordpress-2017-survey\">the 2017 WordPress User Survey</a> is out now.</p>\n<p>The information collected in the survey is used to make informed decisions about improvements across the WordPress project, so your answers are incredibly valuable and help shape the future of the platform.</p>\n<h2>WordPress 4.8.3 Security Release</h2>\n<p>At the end of October, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/10/wordpress-4-8-3-security-release/\">WordPress 4.8.3 was released</a> containing an important security fix for all previous versions of WordPress. If your WordPress installation has not updated automatically, please update it now to protect your site.</p>\n<p>This security issue was brought to light by a community member, so if you ever discover a security vulnerability in WordPress core, please do the same and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/\">disclose it responsibly</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress 4.9 Nearly Ready for Release</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.9 was in rapid development this month. We released four beta versions and published a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/10/wordpress-4-9-release-candidate/\">release candidate</a>. The target for shipping WordPress 4.9 is November 14 — just two short weeks away. With many new features, this is a hugely exciting release that improves WordPress’ user experience considerably. Notably, you’ll see <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/24/a-new-themes-experience-in-the-customizer/\">improvements to the theme selection experience</a>, plenty of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/24/widget-improvements-in-wordpress-4-9/\">widget enhancements</a>, drastically improved <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/22/code-editing-improvements-in-wordpress-4-9/\">code editing</a>, and much better <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/15/improvements-for-roles-and-capabilities-in-4-9/\">user role management</a>.</p>\n<p>To get involved in building WordPress Core, jump into the #core channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Charity Hackathons are Growing</h2>\n<p>For the last few years, the number of <a href=\"https://doaction.org/\">do_action series of WordPress charity hackathons</a> has grown around the world. What started as a community event to assist local nonprofit organizations, has become something many WordPress communities are replicating in an increasing number of cities.</p>\n<p>As of this month, do_action events have been hosted in Cape Town and Johannesburg, South Africa, Beirut, Lebanon, Austin, Texas, and Montréal, Canada. In addition, events are now scheduled for <a href=\"https://doaction.org/event/bristol-2018/\">Bristol, England</a> and <a href=\"https://doaction.org/event/zurich-2018/\">Zurich, Switzerland</a> in 2018.</p>\n<p>To get involved in organizing a do_action event locally, read <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/\">the do_action organizer’s handbook</a> and join the #community-events channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>Gutenberg Development Advances</h2>\n<p>While work steadily continues on Gutenberg — the new editor for WordPress core — one update from this month addresses one of the primary concerns that some people shared about the project.</p>\n<p>Up until <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/24/whats-new-in-gutenberg-24th-october/\">the release on October 24</a>, Gutenberg did not support the meta boxes that so many WordPress content creators rely on. The new editor now has initial support for meta boxes as well as a host of other critical features for content creation in WordPress.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/\">Test out Gutenberg</a> right now and help develop it by joining the #core-editor channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a> and following the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Core team blog</a>.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>DonateWC, a new initiative that assists people in attending WordCamps, <a href=\"https://donatewc.org/wordcamp-stories/wordcamp-cape-town-experience/\">sponsored Trust Nhokovedzo from Harare, Zimbabwe</a> to speak at WordCamp Cape Town, South Africa this month.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/2017/10/saying-goodbye-to-canvas/\">The popular Canvas theme was retired</a> this month to allow WooCommerce to focus on moving their products forward more effectively.</li>\n<li>The next installment of Camp Press, the WordPress community retreat event, will take place <a href=\"https://camp.press/event/iceland2018/\">in Iceland</a>.</li>\n<li>If you run a WordPress meetup group, but are struggling to find content for your events, the WordPress Marketing team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/10/04/supporting-for-meetups-with-low-content/\">has put together some ideas</a> to help.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://2017.us.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp US 2017</a> is just around the corner — there’s still time to grab your tickets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\">submit it here</a>.</em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"5044\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"WordPress 4.8.3 Security Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/10/wordpress-4-8-3-security-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 31 Oct 2017 14:20:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:3:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"4.8\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=5035\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:378:\"WordPress 4.8.3 is now available.

We’ve been working on making it even easier to customize your site. Here are some of the bigger items to test and help us find as many bugs as possible in the coming weeks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Drafting (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39896\">#39896</a>) and scheduling (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28721\">#28721</a>) of changes in the Customizer. Once you save or schedule a changeset, when any user comes into the Customizer the pending changes will be autoloaded. A button is provided to discard changes to restore the Customizer to the last published state. (This is a new “linear” mode for changesets, as opposed to “branching” mode which can be enabled by filter so that every time  user opens the Customizer a new blank changeset will be started.)</li>\n<li>Addition of a frontend preview link to the Customizer to allow changes to be browsed on the frontend, even without a user being logged in (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39896\">#39896</a>).</li>\n<li>Addition of autosave revisions in the Customizer (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39275\">#39275</a>).</li>\n<li>A brand new theme browsing experience in the Customizer (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37661\">#37661</a>).</li>\n<li>Gallery widget (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41914\">#41914</a>), following the media and image widgets introduced in 4.8.</li>\n<li>Support for shortcodes in Text widgets (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10457\">#10457</a>).</li>\n<li>Support for adding media to Text widgets (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40854\">#40854</a>).</li>\n<li>Support for adding oEmbeds outside post content, including Text widgets (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/34115\">#34115</a>).</li>\n<li>Support for videos from providers other than YouTube and Vimeo in the Video widget (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42039\">#42039</a>)</li>\n<li>Improve the flow for creating new menus in the Customizer (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40104\">#40104</a>).</li>\n<li>Educated guess mapping of nav menus and widgets when switching themes (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39692\">#39692</a>).</li>\n<li>Plugins: Introduce singular capabilities for activating and deactivating individual plugins (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38652\">#38652</a>).</li>\n<li>Sandbox PHP file edits in both plugins and themes, without auto-deactivation when an error occurs; a PHP edit that introduces a fatal error is rolled back with an opportunity then for the user to fix the error and attempt to re-save. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21622\">#21622</a>).</li>\n<li>Addition of dirty state for widgets on the admin screen, indicating when a widget has been successfully saved and showing an “Are you sure?” dialog when attempting to leave without saving changes.

Integration includes support for linters to catch errors before you attempt to save. Includes new APIs for plugins to instantiate editors. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/12423\">#12423</a>)</li>\n<li>Introduction of an extensible code editor control for adding instances of CodeMirror to the Customizer. (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41897\">#41897</a>)</li>\n<li>Addition of global notifications area (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/35210\">#35210</a>), panel and section notifications (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38794\">#38794</a>), and a notification overlay that takes over the entire screen in the Customizer (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37727\">#37727</a>).</li>\n<li>A date/time control in the Customizer (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42022\">#42022</a>).</li>\n<li>Improve usability of Customize JS API (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42083\">#42083</a>, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37964\">#37964</a>, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/36167\">#36167</a>).</li>\n<li>Introduction of control templates for base controls (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/30738\">#30738</a>).</li>\n<li>Use WP_Term_Query when transforming tax queries (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37038\">#37038</a>).</li>\n<li>Database: Add support for MySQL servers connecting to IPv6 hosts (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41722\">#41722</a>).</li>\n<li>Emoji: Bring Twemoji compatibility to PHP (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/35293\">#35293</a>). Test for any weirdness with emoji in RSS feeds or emails.</li>\n<li>I18N: Introduce the Plural_Forms class (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41562\">#41562</a>).</li>\n<li>Media: Upgrade MediaElement.js to 4.2.5-74e01a40 (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39686\">#39686</a>).</li>\n<li>Media: Use max-width for default captions (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/33981\">#33981</a>). We will want to make sure this doesn’t cause unexpected visual regressions in existing themes, default themes were all fine in testing.</li>\n<li>Media: Reduce duplicated custom header crops in the Customizer (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/21819\">#21819</a>).</li>\n<li>Media: Store video creation date in meta (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/35218\">#35218</a>). Please help test different kinds of videos.</li>\n<li>Multisite: Introduce get_site_by() (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40180\">#40180</a>).</li>\n<li>Multisite: Improve get_blog_details() by using get_site_by() (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/40228\">#40228</a>).</li>\n<li>Multisite: Improve initializing available roles when switch sites (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38645\">#38645</a>).</li>\n<li>Multisite: Initialize a user&#8217;s roles correctly when setting them up for a different site (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/36961\">#36961</a>).</li>\n<li>REST API: Support registering complex data structures for settings and meta</li>\n<li>REST API: Support for objects in schema validation and sanitization (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/38583\">#38583</a>)</li>\n<li>Role/Capability: Introduce capabilities dedicated to installing and updating language files (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/39677\">#39677</a>).</li>\n<li>Remove SWFUpload (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41752\">#41752</a>).</li>\n<li>Users: Require a confirmation link in an email to be clicked when a user attempts to change their email address (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/16470\">#16470</a>).</li>\n<li>Core and the unit test suite is fully compatible with the upcoming release of PHP 7.2</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want a more in-depth view of what major changes have made it into 4.9, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-9/\">check out posts tagged with 4.9 on the main development blog</a>, or look at a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&amp;resolution=fixed&amp;milestone=4.9&amp;group=component&amp;order=priority\">list of everything</a> that’s changed.

Still, the WordPress Core team is exploring a move <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2463\">to make WordPress framework-agnostic</a>, so that the framework being used could be replaced by any other framework without affecting the rest of the project.</p>\n<p>This is a bold move that will ultimately make WordPress core a lot more flexible, and will also protect it from potential license changes in the future.</p>\n<p>You can get involved in the JavaScript discussion by joining the #core-js channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a> and following the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">WordPress Core development blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>Community Initiative to Make WordCamps More Accessible</h2>\n<p>A WordPress community member, Ines van Essen, started a new nonprofit initiative to offer financial assistance to community members to attend WordCamps. <a href=\"https://donatewc.org/\">DonateWC</a> launched with a crowdsourced funding campaign to cover the costs of getting things up and running.</p>\n<p>Now that she’s raised the initial funds, Ines plans to set up a nonprofit organization and use donations from sponsors to help people all over the world attend and speak at WordCamps.</p>\n<p>If you would like to support the initiative, you can do so by <a href=\"https://donatewc.org/make-a-donation/\">donating through their website</a>.</p>\n<h2>The WordCamp Incubator Program Returns</h2>\n<p>Following the success of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/06/30/wordcamp-incubator-report/\">the first WordCamp Incubator Program</a>, the Community Team is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/09/27/wordcamp-incubator-program-v2-new-role-name/\">bringing the program back</a> to assist more underserved cities in kick-starting their WordPress communities.</p>\n<p>The program’s first phase aims to find community members who will volunteer to mentor, assist, and work alongside local leaders in the incubator communities — this is a time-intensive volunteer role that would need to be filled by experienced WordCamp organizers.</p>\n<p>If you would like to be a part of this valuable initiative, join the #community-team channel in

the free platform and services available.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In a (not completely) serendipitous coincidence, September 30 has also been declared by the United Nations “International Translation Day”, to pay homage to the great services of translators everywhere, one that allows communication and exchange.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">The event will feature a series of multi-language live speeches (training sessions, tutorials, case histories, etc.) that will be screen-casted in streaming, starting from Australia and the Far East and ending in the Western parts of the United States.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">In that same 24-hour time frame, Polyglots worldwide will gather physically in local events, for dedicated training and translations sprints (and for some fun and socializing as well), while those unable to physically join their teams will do so remotely.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">A big, fun, useful and enlightening party and a lovely mix of growing, giving, learning and teaching, to empower, and cultivate, and shine.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Here are some

happening on GitHub. Yesterday, WordPress developer Kevin Hoffman created an issue titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/3304\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Are iframes a viable long-term solution for meta boxes?</a>&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg 1.5 introduced <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-1-5-adds-initial-support-for-meta-boxes-makes-gutenberg-the-default-editor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">initial support for meta boxes</a>. Hoffman identified several issues with iframes that have been popping up as developers have begun testing the current meta box implementation. He did some performance testing that revealed Gutenberg&#8217;s use of iframes triples the number of asset requests, as it enqueues all of the CSS and JS assets in the parent window as well as in all the iframes.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gutenberg-iframes-request.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>image credit: Kevin Hoffman\n<p>&#8220;Generally speaking, iframes have been discouraged in web development for many years for reasons that are well-documented,&#8221; Hoffman said, before citing a litany of issues that plugin developers have already discovered in testing Gutenberg&#8217;s meta box support. &#8220;Can these issues be addressed without requiring modification of the theme or plugin that generates the meta box? We have to consider that third-party code that has powered meta boxes for years may not have the luxury of being updated in order to be compatible within an iframe.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg design lead Tammie Lister responded to Hoffman&#8217;s concerns, indicating that the current implementation of meta boxes is simply an experiment and not necessarily what would land in WordPress 5.0:</p>\n<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s good to think a little that what we have today for meta boxes in Gutenberg is an experiment, in many respects it&#8217;s a holding pattern as the project works out the direction to take. In saying that it&#8217;s one that works &#8216;for now&#8217; but isn&#8217;t what we would ship with.</p>\n<p>All the above said, I think it&#8217;s important to look at what in the future metaboxes will be used for. What are the cases (if any) that would not be converted to blocks? Do all metaboxes have to work on mobile? Is there even an alternative interface that we haven&#8217;t explored? I bet there is. Right now, it&#8217;s about looking at those possibilities and getting on a road that works for the state right now and the future state.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The presentation of this implementation as an experiment that &#8220;works for now&#8221; (but would not be shipped) comes as a surprise after Gutenberg 1.5 arrived with the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/24/whats-new-in-gutenberg-24th-october/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a> that &#8220;this release includes long awaited meta-boxes support (needs testing!)&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hoffman contends that the iframe approach doesn&#8217;t even work &#8216;for now,&#8217; as the issue was opened in order to cite several major ways where it is broken. If Gutenberg moves forward with the current approach, it would require many plugins to be modified in order to be compatible with WordPress 5.0, which Hoffman said would defeat the whole purpose of supporting legacy meta boxes.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I have not seen any evidence to date that suggests meta boxes will continue working with Gutenberg,&#8221; Hoffman said. &#8220;If the answer is no, then we ought to stop pretending that 5.0 will be just another WordPress release and start being honest about breaking backwards compatibility.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Edwin Cromley, a collaborator on the project, <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/3304#issuecomment-341470058\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> that the team anticipates that certain themes and plugins will be broken and that it is not possible to accommodate every possible use case. He admitted that the iframe solution may not meet the project&#8217;s goals. Instead, he advocates creating the best experience for the vast majority of users.</p>\n<p>However, the current approach would adversely affect many sites out there that use WordPress primarily as a CMS with meta boxes. WordPress core committer Scott Taylor <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/3304#issuecomment-341500339\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">expressed concerns</a> about custom post types, many of which do not make use of the traditional &#8220;content&#8221; section in favor of meta boxes only.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In this current iteration, meta box support is an add-on, when in many people&#8217;s reality, meta boxes ARE the UI, the API, the mechanism they use to compose their CMS,&#8221; Taylor said. &#8220;iframes are the gulag.</p>\n<p>&#8220;And we are forgetting the values WP has been built on forever: I should be able to update to the latest version of WP, and have to rewrite nothing. I have so many projects in the wild on WP that I will never touch again. Can I be confident that some of them won&#8217;t break wildly with this change?&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hoffman advocated scaling back the scope of the project to focus on the editor component, a popular opinion that many plugin developers share and one that was illustrated in detail in Yoast&#8217;s post proposing an <a href=\"https://yoast.com/gutenberg-alternative-approach/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">alternative approach to Gutenberg</a>. This approach stages out the changes to the edit screen, giving developers more time to update their plugins, as well as allowing the Gutenberg team to find an adequate solution for meta boxes.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gutenberg-scaled-back.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>&#8220;I think that goal would be a lot more achievable if Gutenberg stuck to overhauling the editor rather than taking over the entire page,&#8221; Hoffman said. &#8220;Then we could leave the existing hooks in place and meta boxes could continue to communicate with each other as they do now. Also, asset enqueuing would be a non-issue since it would work as it does today.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in strong agreement with this concept put forth by Yoast, which seems to me like it would maintain much of the work already done while scaling back the scope of the project to focus on the editor component.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gutenberg engineer Riad Benguella indicated the team is not too keen on working towards this concept.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Reusing Gutenberg pieces to build this concept is relatively doable, but this is not the UX we want to optimize for, we want to build the best possible editor first and make it available for people without backwards compatibility concerns (fresh installs, no metaboxes&#8230;),&#8221; Benguella said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When we think the ideal vision of Gutenberg is ready to ship, we&#8217;ll have time to discuss upgrade path strategies, a concept like this one is an option for an upgrade path, but definitely not as the final product. Other upgrade paths are also possible.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The WordPress developer community is not, however, in favor of delaying this discussion once again. Many are eager to finally answer the question of how meta boxes will fit into the context of the Gutenberg editor so they know how to prepare. Given the numerous issues with the iframes approach, rendering legacy PHP meta boxes under the new editor will require more experimentation and possibly an alternative solution.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Why devote thousands of hours into developing the ideal editor if it cannot be made compatible with existing sites?&#8221; Hoffman said. &#8220;If the first impression is that it breaks the UI they depend on, users will never experience the ideal editor in the first place.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think it may be a mistake to put this off too far,&#8221; WordPress core committer Aaron Jorbin said. &#8220;Especially since many organizations are going to need at least 1-2 quarters to prepare.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mark Kaplun suggests the Gutenberg team use a popular plugin as a gauge for the success of current and future meta box support experiments.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My productive suggestion, is to not declare meta boxes ready, as long as Yoast SEO does not properly work in it,&#8221; Kaplun said. &#8220;It is both slightly complex in terms of interactions and it is installed on shit loads of sites. If Gutenberg cannot work with it, probably no one is going to use it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Greg Schoppe, who has tested and <a href=\"https://gschoppe.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">written extensively on Gutenberg&#8217;s ongoing development</a>, joined the conversation to advocate for Yoast&#8217;s alternative approach to the project as well.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I highly support Yoast&#8217;s view of Gutenberg,&#8221; Schoppe said. &#8220;It is unclear to me how &#8216;upgrade the visual editor&#8217; was reinterpreted to be &#8216;replace the entire post edit interface&#8217; by the Gutenberg team, but it seems directly at odds with the so-called &#8216;Ship of Theseus.&#8217;</p>\n<p>&#8220;In this case, the lack of clear direction and support for the existing standard workflows is actively hurting developers now. How can I move forward building a project, without a trusted set of hooks and tools that I can rely on? It is unconscionable to think that such a large software project would entirely upend the standard workflow for developers in a single update. and it is insane that these conversations are just happening now, in November, when the plan is to have a merge approved at the beginning of the year.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/3304\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">discussion regarding the iframes approach to meta boxes</a> was opened yesterday is still relatively new, but so far the Gutenberg team&#8217;s responses have failed to adequately address the concerns of the developer community in this thread. Finding an approach to meta boxes that preserves WordPress&#8217; powerful CMS capabilities, without alienating users and developers, is one of the Gutenberg team&#8217;s greatest challenges. They are still aiming at producing a merge proposal early next year, but with meta boxes still in the experimentation stage, the team&#8217;s anticipated timetable continues to put the project at odds with the WordPress developer community.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 03 Nov 2017 23:44:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"WPTavern: Bianca Welds Awarded Kim Parsell Travel Scholarship\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=76264\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wptavern.com/bianca-welds-awarded-kim-parsell-travel-scholarship\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2512:\"<p><img />The WordPress Foundation has awarded <a href=\"http://biancawelds.com/now/\">Bianca Welds</a> with the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-foundation-creates-a-traveling-scholarship-in-memory-of-kim-parsell\">Kim Parsell travel scholarship</a> to <a href=\"https://2017.us.wordcamp.org/2017/11/01/announcing-the-kim-parsell-memorial-scholarship-winner-bianca-welds/\">attend WordCamp US 2017</a>.

After 4.9 is released, users visiting <strong>wp-admin/press-this.php</strong> will be prompted to install the plugin from WordPress.org.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/press-this-plugin-prompt.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>A revamped version of Press This <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/02/18/press-this-revamp-merge-proposal/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">landed in WordPress 4.2</a>, released two years ago. Contributors had been talking about switching it to use the REST API instead of admin-ajax since the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/preview-the-press-this-bookmarklet-redesign-alpha-plugin-now-ready-for-testing\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2014 redesign of the bookmarklet</a>. This update is still on the plugin&#8217;s roadmap for anyone interested in contributing to its development.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Following the importers and the link manager, it&#8217;s about time to say goodbye to Press This,&#8221; WordPress lead developer Andrew Ozz said in a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41689\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> proposing the feature&#8217;s retirement. &#8220;Bookmarklets were popular seven &#8211; eight years ago, and now are considered mostly &#8216;old tech.&#8217; The Press This usage was dwindling for the last several years. Currently it is at under 0.2% of the wp-admin requests (as far as I can tell). It seems best to extract it from core to a plugin, similarly to the importers.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>What Use is Press This without the Bookmarklet?</h3>\n<p>Development on Press This&#8217; accompanying bookmarklet feature has also been discontinued. Older bookmarklets will not work with the new canonical plugin.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Usage of bookmarklets across the web has decreased significantly and bad actors attempting to trick users to preform unsavory actions increased over the years,&#8221; Brandon Kraft said in a post announcing Press This&#8217; retirement. &#8220;Coupled with advancing toward a new editing in experience in core, we decided it was a suitable time to make these changes in one swift move.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Heavy users of Press This might wonder what the feature is worth without the bookmarklet. Posting through the interface will now require more copying and pasting. The URL scanning remains, but it&#8217;s not as efficient as highlighting a portion of text on a page and clicking on the bookmarklet to auto-populate a new post in WordPress. This change makes the plugin simpler to maintain but removes the time-saving feature that made Press This feel like magic.</p>\n<p>&#8220;With the rise of bad actors attempting to trick folks to entering their credentials via phishing attempts, I removed the functionality in an effort to not promote requesting credentials after firing off JavaScript on a random site,&#8221; Kraft said. &#8220;To set expectations, I am not foreseeing a change in this decision; however, I support continued conversation and dialogue.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kraft opened a GitHub <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/press-this/issues/15\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">issue</a> on the plugin&#8217;s new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/press-this\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">repository</a> to centralize any discussion regarding restoring the bookmarklet functionality.</p>\n<p>Any plugin authors who have extended Press This will need to update their plugins with a check for plugin availability as demonstrated in <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/browser/trunk/src/wp-admin/press-this.php\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wp-admin/press-this.php</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 02 Nov 2017 22:18:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"WPTavern: GitHub Launches Community Forums to Connect Developers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=76187\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"https://wptavern.com/github-launches-community-forums-to-connect-developers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3622:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-02-at-11.55.24-AM-e1509641805292.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>GitHub <a href=\"https://github.community/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">launched its new community forums</a> this week as another way for the platform&#8217;s 24 million developers to stay connected. The company built them on top of the <a href=\"https://www.lithium.com/products/online-communities/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lithium SaaS community platform</a>, a popular choice for enterprise customers, including Sony, Cisco, HP, Skype, Barclaycard, Symantec, Google, and PayPal.</p>\n<p>The first iteration of the forums includes a gamification aspect that rewards participants for interaction and contribution. Users can &#8220;rank up&#8221; by receiving &#8220;Kudos&#8221; and providing solutions to questions on the forums. GitHub plans to expand on these features in the future.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-02-at-12.47.22-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Naturally, this style of ranking and participation led users to be curious whether GitHub is aiming to have its forums become a StackOverflow Q&amp;A platform alternative. When asked what the company had in mind when designing this feature, GitHub Community Manager Nadia Padzensky <a href=\"https://github.community/t5/Welcome/What-are-the-primary-use-cases-for-community-forum/m-p/286/highlight/false#M81\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> the forums provide another avenue for open discussion on ideas and general questions unrelated to specific projects.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Issues don’t always lend themselves well to these kinds of discussions; however, a forum presents a place designed specifically for these types of conversations,&#8221; Padzensky said. &#8220;In the past, we’ve not had a GitHub-owned space for users to engage with each other in this way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GitHub has also launched an educational section called <a href=\"https://github.community/t5/GitHub-Original-Series/ct-p/GitHubOriginalSeries\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GitHub Original Series</a> with articles from staff on workflows and features, written on topics that users often ask about in private support emails. The team plans to build out this section of the site while adding more features to the forums.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are looking to add contests, polls, and better processes and tooling for taking user feature requests,&#8221; Padzensky said. &#8220;Additionally, the Community Forum will adapt to its members needs; Community Forum member activity and feedback will directly help inform what the Community Forum evolves into.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The ability to keep in touch with its user base is perhaps the most important function the forums will provide to GitHub. It offers a space where users can discussion problems they are having with GitHub&#8217;s products and have those concerns heard by staff. This could potentially help the company avoid public relations disasters like last year&#8217;s when a group of open source project maintainers confronted GitHub with an open letter of complaints regarding issue management. The company <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/github-responds-to-letter-from-open-source-project-maintainers\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">admitted to having become disconnected from the needs of its open source community</a> and promised to launch new features that would better serve community-led projects, as well as make it easer for developers to offer feedback on the products it is building.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 02 Nov 2017 19:00:17 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"BuddyPress: BuddyPress 2.9.2 Security and Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://buddypress.org/?p=268770\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://buddypress.org/2017/11/buddypress-2-9-2-security-and-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1580:\"<p>BuddyPress 2.9.2 is now available.

If your WordPress installation has not updated automatically, please update it now to protect your site.</p>\n<p>This security issue was brought to light by a community member, so if you ever discover a security vulnerability in WordPress core, please do the same and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/\">disclose it responsibly</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress 4.9 Nearly Ready for Release</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.9 was in rapid development this month. We released four beta versions and published a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/10/wordpress-4-9-release-candidate/\">release candidate</a>. The target for shipping WordPress 4.9 is November 14 — just two short weeks away. With many new features, this is a hugely exciting release that improves WordPress’ user experience considerably. Notably, you’ll see <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/24/a-new-themes-experience-in-the-customizer/\">improvements to the theme selection experience</a>, plenty of <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/24/widget-improvements-in-wordpress-4-9/\">widget enhancements</a>, drastically improved <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/22/code-editing-improvements-in-wordpress-4-9/\">code editing</a>, and much better <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/15/improvements-for-roles-and-capabilities-in-4-9/\">user role management</a>.</p>\n<p>To get involved in building WordPress Core, jump into the #core channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>, and follow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">the Core team blog</a>.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Charity Hackathons are Growing</h2>\n<p>For the last few years, the number of <a href=\"https://doaction.org/\">do_action series of WordPress charity hackathons</a> has grown around the world. What started as a community event to assist local nonprofit organizations, has become something many WordPress communities are replicating in an increasing number of cities.</p>\n<p>As of this month, do_action events have been hosted in Cape Town and Johannesburg, South Africa, Beirut, Lebanon, Austin, Texas, and Montréal, Canada. In addition, events are now scheduled for <a href=\"https://doaction.org/event/bristol-2018/\">Bristol, England</a> and <a href=\"https://doaction.org/event/zurich-2018/\">Zurich, Switzerland</a> in 2018.</p>\n<p>To get involved in organizing a do_action event locally, read <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/do_action-charity-hackathon/\">the do_action organizer’s handbook</a> and join the #community-events channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n<h2>Gutenberg Development Advances</h2>\n<p>While work steadily continues on Gutenberg — the new editor for WordPress core — one update from this month addresses one of the primary concerns that some people shared about the project.</p>\n<p>Up until <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/24/whats-new-in-gutenberg-24th-october/\">the release on October 24</a>, Gutenberg did not support the meta boxes that so many WordPress content creators rely on. The new editor now has initial support for meta boxes as well as a host of other critical features for content creation in WordPress.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/call-for-testing/gutenberg-testing/\">Test out Gutenberg</a> right now and help develop it by joining the #core-editor channel in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">Making WordPress Slack group</a> and following the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Core team blog</a>.</p>\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>DonateWC, a new initiative that assists people in attending WordCamps, <a href=\"https://donatewc.org/wordcamp-stories/wordcamp-cape-town-experience/\">sponsored Trust Nhokovedzo from Harare, Zimbabwe</a> to speak at WordCamp Cape Town, South Africa this month.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/2017/10/saying-goodbye-to-canvas/\">The popular Canvas theme was retired</a> this month to allow WooCommerce to focus on moving their products forward more effectively.</li>\n<li>The next installment of Camp Press, the WordPress community retreat event, will take place <a href=\"https://camp.press/event/iceland2018/\">in Iceland</a>.</li>\n<li>If you run a WordPress meetup group, but are struggling to find content for your events, the WordPress Marketing team <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2017/10/04/supporting-for-meetups-with-low-content/\">has put together some ideas</a> to help.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://2017.us.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp US 2017</a> is just around the corner — there’s still time to grab your tickets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>If you have a story we should consider including in the next “Month in WordPress” post, please <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/month-in-wordpress-submissions/\">submit it here</a>.</em></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 02 Nov 2017 12:02:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15:\"Hugh Lashbrooke\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"Matt: New Backpack: Aer Fit Pack\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=47625\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://ma.tt/2017/11/new-backpack-aer-fit-pack/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:979:\"<a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/11/new-backpack-aer-fit-pack/\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2017/11/11002_fp2_black_34.jpeg?resize=266%2C266&ssl=1\" /></a>\n<p>As an interim update to my <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/05/whats-in-my-bag-2017/\">2017 gear post</a>, I&#x27;d like to strongly endorse the <a href=\"https://www.aersf.com/fit-pack-2-black/\">Aer Fit Pack 2</a> as my new primary backpack, replacing the Lululemon bag I suggested before. It has better material, much better zippers, a logical design, more pocket distribution inside, and it&#x27;s cheaper!

The block toolbar has been <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2998\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">relocated to the top of the editor</a>, a suggestion that was mocked up and described in detail in a post on the Yoast SEO blog proposing <a href=\"https://yoast.com/gutenberg-alternative-approach/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">an alternative approach for Gutenberg</a>.</p>\n<p>Prior to version 1.6, users could inadvertantly end up in a situation like the screenshot below &#8211; with tools and toggles popping into view from all sides of a block.</p>\n<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-01-at-5.17.46-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>Gutenberg prior to version 1.6\n<p>Previously, any small mouse move would pull the block toolbar back into view, which made for a somewhat jarring writing experience. Gutenberg 1.6 makes the block toolbar completely independent of the content by fixing it to the top of the editor. This move reduces the amount of visual distraction in the writing zone, while keeping the toolbar accessible in a way that is familiar to users coming from the Classic Editor.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-01-at-5.24.34-PM-e1509575932134.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The toolbar will automatically adjust to display tools specific to the block type that is in focus, so that users don&#8217;t have to sift through other tools that are not applicable to that specific type of content. It does not show if no blocks are selected.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gutenberg-block-toolbar.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>In the ticket proposing the change, Gutenberg designer Joen Asmussen describes it as part of a larger effort to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/2983\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">try to reduce the visual weight of the block</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The cognitive load of the chrome we show around and in context of the block unit has been an ongoing topic for a while,&#8221; Asmussen said. &#8220;Concerns have been noted that it feels heavy, there are many toolbars, options, and it gets in the way of writing.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Placing the block toolbar to the top of the editor is a strong move toward making blocks feel lighter, and version 1.6 includes several other UI tweaks along the same theme. It introduces an alternate style for block boundaries and multi-selection that removes the previous hover and selected styles for blocks, which were somewhat heavy-handed and distracting. Instead, hovering over blocks will simply bring the floating settings dots into view on the side of the block. Contributors also redesigned the selection styles to be more subtle, making the separator, more, and button UI items feel more lightweight.</p>\n<p>Other visual changes include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Engage &#8220;edit&#8221; mode when using arrow keys (hides UI)</li>\n<li>Complete rework of arrow keys navigation between blocks—faster, clearer, and respects caret position while traversing text blocks</li>\n<li>Added keyboard shortcuts to navigate regions</li>\n<li>Implement multi-selection mode using just arrow with shift keys and support horizontal arrows</li>\n<li>Change visual style of multi-selected blocks so it has the same color as highlighted text does</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Gutenberg 1.6 introduces the ability to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/3179\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">convert a classic block (post) into several Gutenblocks</a>. The resulting divided block is fairly instantaneous.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-01-at-6.47.03-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-1-5-adds-initial-support-for-meta-boxes-makes-gutenberg-the-default-editor\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Version 1.5</a> of the plugin added initial support for meta boxes in an Extended Settings panel beneath the post content. Version 1.6 changes the UI to make meta boxes part of the main column, instead of a collapsible box. Plugin developers had complained that the UI gave the impression of having been pinned to the bottom as &#8220;a bit of an afterthought.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think the current design does meta boxes a real disservice,&#8221; one tester, Patrick B., <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-1-5-adds-initial-support-for-meta-boxes-makes-gutenberg-the-default-editor#comment-238575\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">commented</a> on our post. &#8220;The current layout and the section heading, “Extended Settings,” makes it look and feel like a bit of an afterthought. Undoubtably, many meta boxes will be able to be moved to their own blocks, but there will still be situations where what is contained under Extended Settings is essential to putting together a page but isn’t appropriate as a block. In that case, Extended Settings just doesn’t feel right and seems easily forgettable. That could create an awkward publishing experience, especially when those fields are required to publish.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Meta boxes now appear below the content without the Extended Settings label and individual accordion items are toggled closed by default. The bottom section appears regardless of whether or not the sidebar Settings panel is toggled open, so it is always there. This is a change from the previous release where toggling the sidebar Settings panel open was required to see the Extended Settings panel.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Screen-Shot-2017-11-01-at-7.04.00-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Gutenberg 1.6 is a fairly large release with several dozen fixes and performance improvements.

If you&#8217;re just now getting started on your journey to <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2015-javascript-and-api-driven-interfaces-are-the-future-of-wordpress\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">learning JavaScript deeply</a>, this 23-lesson video course from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrisoncode\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Sevilleja</a> offers a quick foundation on the basics with 4.7 hours of learning and hands-on practice.</p>\n<p>The course includes lessons that introduce students to the following concepts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Types and Variables</li>\n<li>Operators</li>\n<li>Comparisons</li>\n<li>Conditionals, Flow, and Loops</li>\n<li>Functions</li>\n<li>Objects</li>\n<li>Built-in Objects</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After completing the fundamentals, students move on to build a couple of starter applications. At the end of the course Sevilleja guides students through building a bookmarking type application for grabbing links from the web and storing them in local storage. Code for the course is available on GitHub and requires a basic set of tools: a browser with support for ES6 features, DevTools and the console, and a code editor.</p>\n<p>The course is targeted at those who have already learned HTML and CSS but don&#8217;t know JavaScript yet. It&#8217;s also helpful for developers who have jumped into jQuery, Angular, React, or other libraries but haven&#8217;t taken the time to learn the core language first.</p>\n<p>The Scotch School has two other free courses at the moment: <a href=\"https://scotch.io/courses/10-need-to-know-javascript-concepts\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">10 Need to Know JavaScript Concepts</a> and <a href=\"https://scotch.io/courses/build-an-online-shop-with-vue\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Build an Online Shop with Vue</a>.

Kim Parsell, 1956-2015\" /><p>There are times when I hear a story from the WordPress community and I think &#8220;That&#8217;s a HeroPress story&#8221;, whether it has been or ever will actually be posted on the site. Some stories are just so great that you think &#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s just really great&#8221;. This week&#8217;s essay is one of those stories, but it won&#8217;t be told by the person it&#8217;s about.</p>\n<p>Kim Parsell has one of my absolute favorite HeroPress stories, but we lost her before HeroPress was even properly started. I&#8217;ve keenly felt the loss of the wisdom and joy she would have brought to HeroPress. I only met her in person once, at the last WordCamp San Francisco. She was so very much in her element, even I could see it, who barely knew her.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ve literally spent years now, trying to think of an appropriate way to share her story on HeroPress, and I think this year I found it. The WordPress community was Kim&#8217;s family, and she was our mom. I&#8217;m going to let some of the people closest to her tell some of her story.</p>\n<p>&#8212; Topher</p>\n<blockquote class=\"light\"><p><em>From Jeff Chandler</em></p>\n<p>What did the WordPress community mean to Kim Parsell? Family.</p>\n<p>In order to understand how highly valued the WordPress community was to Kim Parsell, you first have to realize her environment.</p>\n<p>Kim was a middle-aged woman who lived off a dirt road, on top of a hill, in Southern rural Ohio. She was often by herself, taking care of the property with only a few neighbors up and down the road.</p>\n<p>She received internet access from towers that broadcasted wireless signals, similar to cell phones but at lower speeds.</p>\n<p>Through WordPress Weekly, Kim gained access to members of the WordPress community where she was able to talk to them on a weekly basis. The show and its after hours sessions provided Kim a chance to mingle with the who&#8217;s who of WordPress at the time. It helped establish long-lasting relationships that would open up future opportunities.</p>\n<p>In a location where not many around her used or even heard of WordPress, the community was an outlet for her to be around like-minded people. Kim had a blast interacting with people online and at WordCamp events. Many members of the WordPress community became her second family, a responsibility she took very seriously.</p></blockquote>\n<hr />\n<a href=\"http://www.kpimages.net/index.php?showimage=248\"><img class=\"wp-image-2243 size-full\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/20071025160711_dscf2405-pano.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"950\" height=\"500\" /></a>My Backyard, Revisited &#8211; 10/25/2007 &#8211; Kim Parsell<br /> Autumn&#8217;s patchwork quilt has finally descended upon this area &#8211; the trees are in full fall color. This was taken yesterday morning. I tried to take this from just about the same vantage point as the previous one &#8211; I think I got pretty close!<br /> Copyright © 2007 Kim Parsell.

I told him I remembered a whole lot more about how she made me feel versus how she felt about WordPress and the community. (I suppose the saying is true that people don&#8217;t remember what you say, they remember how you made them feel).</p>\n<p>I first remember meeting Kim on Twitter, so I went back and did a search to the earliest <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%40cdils%20AND%20%40kimparsell&src=typd&lang=en\">conversations of ours</a> I could find. They dated back to January 2013, nearly two years to the date after she passed in January 2015. I will always remember Kim, along with Mika Epstein and Andrea Rennick, for their kindness to me when I was new to the community. They were the first &#8220;women of WordPress&#8221; to draw me in and make me feel at home simply by sharing themselves and their knowledge.</p>\n<p>That&#8217;s what community is, right? You share things that are personal, vulnerable even. You share your experiences. In doing that, you naturally invite others to reciprocate. That&#8217;s the environment Kim created with hundreds of others, not just me. Affectionately called #wpmom, Kim was an investor. She invested countless hours into the WordPress project (she had &#8220;props&#8221; for 5 major releases of WP and also volunteered her time for the documentation team). She invested in women who wanted to break into tech. She invested in me.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://carriedils.com/for-you-kim/\">I still well up with tears</a> when I remember Kim. I&#8217;m proud that the WordPress Foundation now offers a scholarship in her memory. She loved this community and this community loved her right back. Her legacy lives on&#8230;</p></blockquote>\n<hr />\n<a href=\"http://www.kpimages.net/index.php?showimage=243\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2244\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/20070930095922_dscf0913.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" /></a>Eastern Tiger &#8211; Posted on 09/30/2007 &#8211; Kim Parsell<br />An Eastern Tiger Swallowtail perches on some tall ironweed that grows down near the pond.

I believe that her participation in WordCamps and the docs team enriched her life; every WC she went to, there was always someone she&#8217;s known online that she would connect with and check up on. She was concerned with everyone&#8217;s well-being.</p>\n<p>She wouldn&#8217;t be a coder in our common understanding, but she understood coders. She understood the pitfalls of an isolated life and encouraged people to reach out and be concerned for one another. Her record of kindness and generosity have set an example for a lot of others to follow.</p></blockquote>\n<hr />\n<a href=\"http://www.kpimages.net/index.php?showimage=235\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2245\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/20070819053504_dscf0784.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" /></a>Misty Morning &#8211; Posted on 08/19/2007 &#8211; Kim Parsell<br />Storms the night before gave way to dense fog in early morning.

And the reciprocal of that is that I sought her approval for what I did, how I behaved and how I handled myself in the WordPress community and in life.</p>\n<p>Just to be clear, she never said or did anything that indicated that her approval was needed. Or that it was a condition for her friendship. But she was #wpmom and that’s just how it was for me. Our online interactions were fun and collaborating with her in the WordPress community was a learning experience for me. I used that experience to become better at my job and it showed.</p>\n<p>When I had to deal with a death in my family, she was one of the people I emailed. I needed that interaction and she was there for me with others in the community.</p>\n<p>I met Kim in person at WordCamp SF 2014. She was amazed at how everyone was treating her. All these people she had contact with and everyone was thrilled to meet her. When the time came, she gave a video presentation on the docs team. She was nervous, had some laptop troubles and didn’t feel prepared. She did fine and I was there cheering her on from the sidelines.</p>\n<p>After WCSF 2014 we stayed in touch and I would send her images of things my children did. When I got the news of her passing it was hard. But she left an amazing example. She taught me and others to take care of yourself, take care of those close to you and be a responsible person. How often do you meet someone like that? I’m so glad for having met her. Just by being herself she made me a better person.</p></blockquote>\n<hr />\n<a href=\"http://www.kpimages.net/index.php?showimage=109\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-2249\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/20070516131722_dscf0942-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\" /></a>Fire at Night, Part II &#8211; Posted on 02/17/2007 &#8211; Kim Parsell<br />7/10/2005 &#8211; The colors become more brilliant as the sky darkens even more.<br />Copyright © 2005 Kim Parsell.

She knew the things she knew, and had a pretty good idea of how to find out the things she didn&#8217;t.</p>\n<p>You&#8217;d be amazed how far the simple quality of that &#8220;self starter&#8221; attitude can take you as a contributor.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I&#8217;m not intentionally diminishing Kim to simply having the will to pull herself up by her proverbial boot straps. It&#8217;s merely to demonstrate the point that Kim&#8217;s temperament and poise in unfamiliar situations was unmatched, and that is one of the reasons why she was able to affect so much positive change in WordPress.</p>\n<p>Kim&#8217;s positive attitude and helping nature was infectious. She had the uncanny ability to walk into a room of complete strangers and walk out with a group of new friends – and newly-gleaned knowledge to go along with it.</p>\n<p>When Kim visited WordCamp San Francisco (the precursor to WordCamp US) for the first time in 2014, it was hugs all around. Literally. Kim had been contributing to WordPress for years and largely never met many of the people she&#8217;d had an opportunity to collaborate with.</p>\n<p>The community summit was being held in conjunction with WCSF that year and the only way she could afford to go was on a travel scholarship offered at the time by the foundation – the same scholarship that now justly bears her name.</p>\n<p>It was an amazing thing to see, made all the more tragic when Kim left us just a few short months later. She was well on her way to realizing her goal of being able to contribute full time and get paid for her effort.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m sad to say Kim never got there, but her spirit lives on in the people she knew and inspired. Here&#8217;s hoping that the Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship will serve to further inspire those who follow in her footsteps.</p></blockquote>\n<hr />\n\n<a

4.8.3 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/10/wordpress-4-8-3-security-release/\">is available</a> and is a security release for 4.8.2 and all previous versions. This release addresses an issue with $wpdb-&gt;prepare() that could lead to a potential SQL injection. While WordPress core is not vulnerable, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardening_(computing)\">hardening</a> has been added to prevent plugins and themes from inadvertently causing a vulnerability.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re experiencing a bit of déjà vu, it&#8217;s because WordPress 4.8.2 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/09/wordpress-4-8-2-security-and-maintenance-release/\">attempted to solve</a> the same problem. <a href=\"https://blog.ircmaxell.com/2017/10/disclosure-wordpress-wpdb-sql-injection-background.html\">According</a> to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ircmaxell\">Anthony Ferrara</a> who <a href=\"https://blog.ircmaxell.com/2017/10/disclosure-wordpress-wpdb-sql-injection-technical.html\">reported and disclosed</a> the vulnerability, the patch in 4.8.2 didn&#8217;t solve the underlying problem and broke many sites.</p>\n<p>Ferrara says he reported the issue immediately after 4.8.2 was released and was ignored by the WordPress security team for several weeks.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When I got the attention of the team, they wanted to fix a subset of the issue I reported,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It became clear to me that releasing a partial fix was worse than no fix (for many reasons). So I decided the only way to make the team realize the full extent was to Full Disclosure the issue.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Full Disclosure is the process of publicly sharing technical details of a vulnerability so that the public knows the same amount of information about it as hackers. The threat of full disclosure is typically used to pressure businesses and software creators to act swiftly and release patches as soon as possible.</p>\n<p>On October 26th, Ferrara used his Twitter account to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ircmaxell/status/923662170092638208\">notify the public</a> that WordPress contained a serious SQLi vulnerability and that because he lacked confidence in the team, fully disclosing it was his only option. His message was retweeted 562 times and liked by 484 people.</p>\n<p>The amount of publicity his Tweet received had an impact as on October 27th, Ferrara reported that constructive discussions resumed with the team and that he would delay the disclosure until October 31st.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">RE: WP Issue: I constructive discussions have resumed with the security team. I will be delaying FD until at earliest the 31st.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Anthony Ferrara (@ircmaxell) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ircmaxell/status/923907743555178496?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 27, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>On October 27th, Ferrara spoke to a member of the WordPress security team who provided a fresh set of eyes to the problem, &#8220;A security team member who hadn’t yet participated in the thread went back to the beginning of the thread and re-read every post,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;He (correctly I may add) summarized the entirety of the issues, as well as asked a few clarifying questions. He also asked for a little more time but gave me a target of Tuesday, October 31st so it wasn’t wide open. This was the response I was looking for the entire time.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Both parties collaborated on a patch that fixed the issue and WordPress 4.8.3 was released. Although his experience started out frustrating, Ferrara is hopeful that the team will do better with future reports.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I get that there are competing priorities,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But show attention. Show that you’ve read what’s written. And if someone tells you it seems like you don’t understand something, stop and get clarification. And ask for help. Overall, I hope the WP security team moves forward from this. I do honestly see hope.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Aaron Campbell, WordPress Security Team Lead, says that although there were some rough patches in working with Ferrara, they were able to work together to get a fix released in the end. While the threat of full disclosure didn&#8217;t have a huge impact on getting the vulnerability patched, it may have been the catalyst to get a new person involved in the process.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A threat of disclosure certainly adds pressure and possibly stress, but doesn’t actually change the overall equation that much.&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;An issue isn’t more severe because it’s going to be disclosed, but it can become more rushed (meaning a higher likelihood of mistakes).</p>\n<p>In this case, I actually think the threat of disclosure ended up coinciding with one of the people from our security team joining in to help out. The new person was much better at communicating with Anthony, and it really turned things around.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the official release post, the WordPress Security Team thanked Ferrara for practicing <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-security-vulnerabilities/\">Responsible Disclosure</a>. This generated some conversation on Twitter on whether responsible disclosure should be renamed to coordinated disclosure.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Dear WordPress:</p>\n<p>Stop calling it \"responsible disclosure\". It\'s \"coordinated disclosure\".</p>\n<p>&mdash; Scott Arciszewski (@CiPHPerCoder) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/CiPHPerCoder/status/925384513307504641?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 31, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>&#8220;I’m not sure I know what the terminology change would be aiming to accomplish,&#8221; Campbell said. &#8220;I do see that some places use this particular phrasing, but honestly I don’t see how it conveys anything that’s not already generally understood with responsible disclosure.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Users are encouraged to update their sites to 4.8.3 as soon as possible.

The deadline for compliance is May 28, 2018, approximately 200 days from now. The Danish duo met at WordCamp Europe a few years ago and were inspired to work together on several projects, with GDPR compliance for WordPress sites being the most urgent item on their list.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We want to create a standard for plugin creators to describe what kind of data they store and how to handle it,&#8221; Suhm said. &#8220;With a standard like this it will be possible to build tools to make WP sites compliant with GDPR. That basically means things like generating privacy policies, tools to export sensitive data, and tools to delete it completely. GDPR is pretty complex, so there will likely be a lot of tools around this. The first thing we need is a standard. It&#8217;s critical especially for EU based companies, and I can tell you that it&#8217;s something people discuss in every meetup and WordCamp over here.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The GDPR for WordPress site includes a summary of website owners&#8217; obligations in regards to collecting data related to EU citizens. It&#8217;s not comprehensive but gives an idea of what items the standard will need to cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tell the user: who you are, why you collect the data, for how long and who receives it.</li>\n<li>Get a clear consent, before collecting any data</li>\n<li>Let users access their data, and take it with them</li>\n<li>Let users delete their data</li>\n<li>Let users know if data breaches occur</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Steffensen and Suhm&#8217;s first step is <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/U9zp6rS1HSDcKZI42\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">surveying WordPress plugin developers</a> to gauge their awareness of the GDPR. They also want to know if developers would be interested in using a free, open source solution, like a simple file with a map of personal and sensitive data stored by their plugins. The GDPR for WordPress team would then use the tool as a foundation to build tools that can take care of compliance by parsing these files.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When we have the survey data we will continue to work on the standard,&#8221; Suhm said. &#8220;It will be 100% open source, so everyone can use it to build whatever they see fit afterwards. So far it&#8217;s just a lot of ideas and we really want to collect as much input as possible so we can get everyone onboard.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The team has created a roadmap that that they will update based on feedback from plugin developers. They plan to work on the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Methodology to describe how a plugin collects, stores, and uses personal data</li>\n<li>Methodology file builder for plugin developers to use</li>\n<li>Provide a clear visual compliance indicator on every plugin installed</li>\n<li>Privacy policy text builder based on installed (compliant) plugins</li>\n<li>Provide an administrative overview on each users data being stored, across plugins</li>\n<li>Provide an administrative way to send user data to a specific user upon request</li>\n<li>Provide an administrative way to delete user data on a specific user upon request</li>\n<li>Add site wide Explicit consent checkbox, with detailed yet plain English on what data is stored, how it is used and how long. (This is a replacement for the cookie popup) – possible disablement of submitting actions until consent is given? The request to collect data should happen to every user before any data is collected, that might also mean cookies.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Despite the quickly approaching deadline, solutions aimed at helping WordPress sites to be compliant with the GDPR are virtually non-existent. There are currently only <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/GDPR/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">six plugins in the directory</a> with descriptions that mention having been built with GDPR compliance and privacy in mind. Many site owners will be woefully unprepared to comply with the legislation.</p>\n<p>A couple of months ago we looked the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gravity-forms-stop-entries-plugin-aims-to-help-sites-comply-with-the-eus-gdpr\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Wider Gravity Forms Stop Entries plugin</a>, which helps site owners protect the privacy of form submissions by preventing them from being stored in the database. Since many plugins don&#8217;t have these options built in, other plugin developers have to extend them to suit their users&#8217; needs. At the moment, there is no standard way of doing this because of the wide variance in how plugins store their data.</p>\n<p>This solution the GDPR for WordPress team is proposing is different in that it aims to give plugin authors a standard for including a meta description of the personal and sensitive data that their plugins stores. The GDPR doesn&#8217;t prohibit plugins from storing personal identifiable data but it does require website owners to detail what, where, and for what purpose it is stored.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The problem right now is that it is almost impossible to figure out what information a WordPress plugin stores and where it is stored,&#8221; Suhm said. &#8220;This will make it possible to build general solutions across plugins to ensure GDPR compliance. An example could be a tool to delete sensitive data from a WordPress site, including the data stored by plugins. That is only possible if plugin authors include some sort of description of their &#8216;data footprint.\'&#8221;</p>\n<p>The biggest challenge the team has is rallying plugin developers to get on board with following a new standard and updating their plugins to provide a data footprint. This is not an easy task as the burden of compliance falls to the website owners, not individual plugin developers. Even if site owners are motivated to educate themselves, the prospect of figuring out what data is being stored and where can be daunting. If the GDPR for WordPress team can successfully get the plugin developer community on board, they can work together to build a suite of tools that help end users get a broad overview of their sites&#8217; GDPR compliance.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 30 Oct 2017 23:20:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"Post Status: The WordPress product market is completely different now\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=39797\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-product-market-completely-different-now/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8685:\"<p><em>This article is a member contribution from Scott Bolinger. Scott is the founder of <a href=\"https://hollerwp.com/\">Holler Box</a> and the co-founder of <a href=\"https://apppresser.com/\">AppPresser</a>.</em></p>\n<p>The WordPress economy is changing, and many businesses are feeling it.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/future-wordpress-economy-im-not-worried/\">market is maturing</a>, and <a href=\"http://chrislema.com/wordpress-economy-shrinking/\">customers are behaving differently</a>. It&#8217;s happening slowly, but I think everyone realizes things are changing.</p>\n<p>Often this change has been discussed in terms of hosts and agencies, but let&#8217;s talk about products.</p>\n<p>I just read an article on Indie Hackers about MH Themes, a premium theme shop that started in 2013. They describe a <a href=\"https://www.indiehackers.com/businesses/mh-themes\">hard-fought journey</a> to a solid $30K in monthly revenue, but they have noticed big changes in the market since they started.</p>\n<p>The author, Michael Hebenstreit, puts it this way:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Back in 2013 it was much easier to launch a WordPress theme and make it somewhat popular. Today the market for WordPress themes has become heavily crowded and oversaturated. It&#8217;s near to impossible to make a theme highly successful without investing lots of time and money in marketing and building a community behind your product.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It comes as no surprise that the theme business is saturated; it <a href=\"http://scottbolinger.com/wordpress-theme-business/\">has been for years</a>. I would now say the plugin business is saturated as well.</p>\n<p>From 2008 to 2010 you could have released just about any decent plugin or theme, and it would have done fairly well, simply because there was very little competition. The WordPress market was in an early and extreme growth phase. People were realizing there was money to be made.</p>\n<p>Many different product categories were ripe for innovation, with no dominant players at all. For example, the eCommerce landscape was wide open before WooCommerce became popular in 2011. Now there is no one even remotely close to them, and <a href=\"https://ithemes.com/exchange/\">competing</a> with WooCommerce doesn&#8217;t seem like a good idea.</p>\n<p>Today what we see in most product categories is at least one dominant player, and many other new entrants at their heels. Backups, security, SEO, themes, page builders, forms, caching, lead generation, and other categories all have stiff competition.</p>\n<p>Previously the competition was a developer trying to figure out how to grow a company. Now it&#8217;s a 30+ person organization with millions of dollars in revenue. iThemes, Yoast, Gravity Forms, Awesome Motive, and WooCommerce are just a few. These companies have a loyal following that makes it harder for smaller shops to take a piece of the pie.</p>\n<p>Popular plugins now have millions of downloads, lots of articles written about them, and avid fans. They are becoming harder and harder to dethrone, or even to challenge for a slice of market share.</p>\n<h3>Your product is a commodity</h3>\n<p>As Alex Turnbull says <a href=\"https://www.groovehq.com/blog/commoditization\">in this recent article</a>, &#8220;if your product isn&#8217;t already a commodity, it will become one in the next few years.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s becoming easier and easier to create and sell a product online. Developers are ubiquitous, websites are cheap, and many people can build something on the side with a full time job.</p>\n<p>That means when you release a product you not only have the established leaders to contend with, but lots smaller players with great products just getting started. Even if your product is great, there are 10 other great products in the same category.</p>\n<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean a great product isn&#8217;t important — it certainly is. It does mean that it&#8217;s not enough.</p>\n<p>If your product isn&#8217;t enough to stand out in a crowded marketplace, what does it take?</p>\n<h3>How to bring a new product to market now</h3>\n<p>The old way of starting a new product might have been to go where there was less competition and create a better product. If there are still places of &#8220;less competition&#8221; they are much harder to see.</p>\n<p>You can go after a niche, but WordPress is already a niche. A niche within a niche is a very small market.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not impossible to slay the giant Goliath product companies. As <a href=\"https://blog.asmartbear.com/compete-on-profit.html\">Jason Cohen</a> points out, they have an Achilles heel: &#8220;The profitable revenue stream is a prison.&#8221; They are slower to adapt to changes in the marketplace because they can still make money doing what they have always done.</p>\n<p>If you are thinking about bringing a new product to market, here are a few observations that may help you.</p>\n<h4>1) It&#8217;s going to be a lot harder than it used to be, and it&#8217;s going to take longer.</h4>\n<p>Can you go for a year (or two) without making any money and still be cranking out code and marketing yourself? That may be what it takes.</p>\n<p>Putting up a website and starting a content strategy takes six months to see any solid organic traffic. Publishing your plugin to official WordPress directory does not result in automatic downloads. The newer search algorithms favor the entrenched plugins that have more downloads and reviews.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s an uphill battle, and it takes time.</p>\n<h4>2) You must have a strategic advantage, or a unique difference to win.</h4>\n<p>Ninja Forms went into a crowded space against one of the most popular plugins of all time, Gravity Forms. They gained an advantage by offering a free version and distributing it on the directory, while Gravity Forms was entirely commercial. Why did they do so much better than other free form plugins? I don’t know, but they certainly executed well, and they have created a great brand.</p>\n<p>Can you find a competitive advantage and exploit it?</p>\n<p>One weakness I see in many WordPress companies is marketing. Many of the early successes in WordPress were coders who made a cool plugin. Most of them are not marketers, and they have enough business without needing to learn marketing. This leaves the door open for companies with great marketing.</p>\n<p>Can you dominate an under-marketed product category?</p>\n<p>You are going to have to do something different and better than what has come before. Copying a business model that worked in 2012 is not a good strategy.</p>\n<h4>3) Branding is more important than ever.</h4>\n<p>Your brand is what will help you gain market share against your competitors.</p>\n<p>A brand is not your logo, and it’s not what you say about your company. It’s what they say. They, as in, your customers.</p>\n<p>Providing great customer service, getting to know people at events, being helpful on social media, providing refunds without asking questions — these are all parts of your brand. Being known for doing good work is another, so that when you release a new product, people just buy it.</p>\n<p>I think of the brand Pippin Williamson has built for himself, since he is known for putting out high quality products. I will buy a plugin he makes over a more established competitor because of his reputation for quality. iThemes is another great example of a company that cares about their customers. They have built a brand on integrity.</p>\n<p>Building a brand takes time, but it is more important than ever.</p>\n<h3>Looking forward</h3>\n<p>The WordPress market is no longer high growth and low competition.</p>\n<p>The companies involved in products are maturing into well staffed, well funded operations. Their fans are loyal, and their products are entrenched. This makes it harder for new entrants into the market to compete.</p>\n<p>New products must have a well thought out strategy to gain traction in this competitive marketplace. Without unique positioning and hard fought execution, they will not survive.</p>\n<p>It’s not all bad news, because this is how most marketplaces look already. It’s a sign that those of us who make products need to get more creative about how we approach product development and marketing.</p>\n<p>As the more successful companies get larger, they will also become more resistant to change. When this happens, newer product offerings will be able to steal market share with fast paced innovation and development.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>This post was originally posted for <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/club\">Post Status Club Members</a>.

DeVore is aiming to make WP Dispensary a complete online menu software solution for dispensaries and delivery services. The business has grown enough over recent months for him to begin working full-time on it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;One of the larger objectives going full time with WP Dispensary was to put together content that was specific for both dispensary owners and freelance WordPress developers,&#8221; Devore said. &#8220;There is a 50/50 split with buyers, so I know that writing content to outline how WPD can help you specifically is an important next step.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Due to recent demand seen in pre-sales questions, DeVore has just released a Dispensary Details plugin to meet the needs of the much larger market of customers using WooCommerce. The plugin does not require WP Dispensary to work.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Instead of leaving a need out there, I looked at WP Dispensary and knew I could create a standalone plugin that added the proper details and displayed cleanly within the WooCommerce structure,&#8221; DeVore said.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.wpdispensary.com/downloads/dispensary-details-for-woocommerce/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Dispensary Details for WooCommerce</a> plugin is the first of its kind for the e-commerce platform. It adds custom taxonomies and metaboxes that allow store owners to add cannabis details to products, including information like compound details, aromas, effects, conditions, vendors, symptoms, and more.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dispensary-details-front-end-table.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The plugin includes separate Edibles and Topicals details boxes where store owners can enter THC/CBD per serving, size, serving count, and net weight. It also has a Grower Details box for cannabis shops that sell clones or seeds with specific sections for origin, average grow time and yield, and the clones/seeds per unit.</p>\n<p>Dispensary Details for WooCommerce works with any WordPress theme and simply adds the new Details tab to product pages alongside the various other tabs that WooCommerce displays. The plugin is priced at $149.00, which includes one year of support and updates.</p>\n<p>The WordPress product market is just starting to build solutions for the growing marijuana industry, and DeVore predicts that WordPress site builders will soon be in high demand.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I feel like the industry is going to become more regulated and also increased banking will allow for companies to focus on the marketing/sales side of the business rather than the business side of the business. With companies like KIND Financial recently putting out a <a href=\"http://kind.financial/kind-seed-payment/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">seed-to-sale solution</a> along with a bank in Canada, it&#8217;s just a sign that things are changing for the better.&#8221;</p>\n<p>DeVore said changes like these will allow businesses to focus on their websites and WordPress developers will have the opportunity to provide solutions for them, just like they already do for so many other industries. Outside of the U.S. there are already many mail order cannabis services in operation and DeVore said inside the U.S. he has noticed a lot of delivery services that are using WP Dispensary with WooCommerce to allow patients to place orders.</p>\n<p>More competition is starting to sprout up for this new niche in the WordPress ecosystem and many of them are working towards providing more comprehensive e-commerce solutions. <a href=\"https://liftedthemes.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Lifted Themes</a> is a shop that sells WordPress plugins and themes for the marijuana industry. The company is working on building products that will sync with major POS or Seed to Sale systems. Similarly, <a href=\"https://h32b.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">H32B</a> provides a theme along with a suite of WooCommerce plugins for medical marijuana dispensaries.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-27-at-3.12.08-PM-e1509135316697.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://mmjecommerce.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">MMJ E-Commerce</a> is another newer company that provides WooCommerce and WordPress plugins and services for dispensaries with a focus on resources for compliance.

One of the annual traditions that&#8217;s part of the event is the <a href=\"https://wordpressdotorg.polldaddy.com/s/wordpress-2017-survey\">WordPress User Survey</a>.

When asked why, Matt Mullenweg replied, &#8220;Lots of data to go over, but basically more people are using WordPress, app development is growing, lots of people are making their living with WordPress, and other great trends are showing up,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We’ll try to do a blog post about it.&#8221;</p>\n<p>That blog post was never published. Additionally, results from last year&#8217;s survey were not shared during the State of the Word or in a blog post.</p>\n<p>Thousands of people take the survey providing insight into trends, how people use the software, and demographics. If users voluntarily provide this data to WordPress.org, sharing the results with the public whether it&#8217;s a blog post, separate session, or during the State of the Word, would be a nice way to return the favor.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 27 Oct 2017 20:04:04 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"WPTavern: Patreon Launches App Directory and Free WordPress Plugin for Membership Sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=76094\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"https://wptavern.com/patreon-launches-app-directory-and-free-wordpress-plugin-for-membership-sites\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3319:\"<p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Patreon</a> was founded in May 2013 as a service with business tools that allow content creators to crowdfund their work through donations and subscriptions.

The upcoming 4.9 release builds on this progress and will introduce some long-awaited improvements to Text widget. Users will finally be able to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/24/widget-improvements-in-wordpress-4-9/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">use shortcodes in the Text widget</a> without the help of additional code from plugins or themes.</p>\n<p>This new feature is the answer to an eight-year-old <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10457\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">ticket</a> requesting shortcode support inside the Text widget. Weston Ruter broke down the technical details in the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2017/10/24/widget-improvements-in-wordpress-4-9/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dev note</a> for the feature, explaining why it took so long to find a solution:</p>\n<blockquote><p>One reason for the long delay with adding shortcode support in Text widgets was due to many shortcodes looking for a global <code>$post</code> when they run. Since the global <code>$post</code> varies depending on whatever the query is, the shortcodes in a Text widget could render wildly different on different templates of a site. The solution worked out was to temporarily nullify the global <code>$post</code> before doing the shortcodes so that they will consistently have the same global state, with this global $post then restored after the shortcodes are done.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Hundreds of thousands of WordPress installations currently <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/search/shortcodes+text+widget/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">use a plugin to add shortcode support to widgets</a>. Contributors to 4.9 have taken this into account so that updating will not cause unexpected issues.</p>\n<p>&#8220;If a plugin has added <code>do_shortcode()</code> to <code>widget_text</code> then this filter will be suspended while the widget runs to prevent shortcodes from being applied twice,&#8221; Ruter said.</p>\n<p>In addition to the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-core-gallery-widget-targeted-for-wordpress-4-9\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">new core gallery widget</a> landing in 4.9, this release will also allow users to embed media in the Text widget. A new &#8220;Add Media&#8221; button is available, making it easy for users to insert images, audio, galleries, and videos, along with text and other content. WordPress 4.9 also adds support for oEmbeds in the Text widget and the Video widget has been updated with expanded support for any oEmbed provider for video.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-26-at-12.00.59-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Little enhancements like these make it easier for users to update their own websites without having to hire a developer or add extra plugins for things that should be simple. The improvements to widgets have also been implemented in such a way that users will be more prepared for how Gutenberg will handle media.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The media-specific widgets are closely aligned with blocks in Gutenberg; the existence of media inside the Text widget will align with eventual nested blocks in Gutenberg, and would be treated as Classic Text blocks in any future migration from widgets to blocks,&#8221; Ruter said.</p>\n<p>WordPress 4.9 will improve the experience of switching between themes by including logic that is better at mapping widgets between two themes&#8217; widget areas. This release will also improve the <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/23120\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">UI for updating and saving widgets</a> in the admin screen. It adds an indicator that shows whether or not widget changes have been saved, as well as a notice if the user attempts to leave the page with unsaved changes.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 26 Oct 2017 05:46:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 292 – Recap of WooConf and CaboPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=76080&preview=true&preview_id=76080\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-292-recap-of-wooconf-and-cabopress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2434:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"https://jjj.blog/\">John James Jacoby</a> and I are joined by Cody Landefeld, co-founder of <a href=\"https://modeeffect.com/\">Mode Effect</a>. Landefeld described his experience attending WooConf as we reviewed highlights from the State of the Woo.</p>\n<p>We also discussed WooCommerce retiring its Canvas theme in favor of Storefront.

Now each browser has mature developer tools. That’s because of Firebug. Mission accomplished!&#8221;</p>\n<p>In recognition of what Firebug brought to developers, Mozilla reviewed one of the most important points in Firebug history &#8211; the decision to open source the software. This allowed for the proliferation of similar browser development tools that we see today. Firebug creator Joe Hewitt, who eventually moved on to Facebook, made the tool open source in December 2006:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The first announcement is in regards to Firebug’s licensing. As I was developing Firebug 1.0, I began to wonder if I should try to turn the project from a hobby into a business. When I proposed this idea on my blog, the response was very positive and reaffirmed my belief that Firebug could do well as a commercial product.<br />\nHowever, in the end, I just don’t feel like that is the right thing to do. I love working on Firebug because I know I’m making a lot of people happy and helping to advance the state of the art. That’s a lot more meaningful to me than just about anything else, and so, I’ve decided that <strong>Firebug will remain free and open source.</strong></p></blockquote>\n<p>Mozilla reported that more than a million people are still using the Firebug add-on. Firefox Developer Tools has a guide for <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Migrating_from_Firebug\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">migrating from Firebug</a>. There are still several Firebug features missing from Firefox DevTools, but <a href=\"https://bugzil.la/991806\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Mozilla is tracking them</a> and working to bring greater parity between the two. Support for the separate Firebug extension will be discontinued with the release of Firefox Quantum (version 57) in November 2017.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 19:26:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.9 Beta 4 Removes ‘Try Gutenberg’ Call to Action\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=76047\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-9-beta-4-removes-try-gutenberg-call-to-action\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5619:\"<p>WordPress beta releases typically don&#8217;t generate controversy but in WordPress 4.9 Beta 3, a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41316\">call to action was added</a> to the dashboard that encouraged users to install and activate <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">Gutenberg</a>.</p>\n<img />Try Gutenberg Call to Action\n<p>Members of the WordPress community raised concerns that clients may install Gutenberg and shared ways to hide the prompt from users.

Before core encourages millions of sites to use the plugin and rely on it functioning a certain way.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Other members of the community advocated for the call to action saying it would lead to a larger test sample.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Getting the public to test Gutenberg is essential.

However, to the best of my knowledge, there has never been a dashboard prompt encouraging users to install and activate a beta plugin on a live site.</p>\n<p>Although the call to action is focused on raising awareness of Gutenberg, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/41316#comment:47\">John James Jacoby suggests</a> that the meta block be rewritten so that it can be recycled for other features or plugins to use in the future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;My concern is that the current approach is not scalable to future feature developments beyond Gutenberg,&#8221; Jacoby said. &#8220;For example, when a new codenamed feature comes along for WordPress 5.2, cloning this same approach does not seem ideal.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He suggests that the dashboard widget become a standard part of the dashboard. &#8220;This way, we can hype the new hotness on an as-needed basis, and plugins that want to hide it forever can reliably do so one time in a plugin,&#8221; Jacoby said.</p>\n<h2>When Is the Right Time to Hype Gutenberg to the Masses?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">Gutenberg</a> is actively installed on more than 3K sites with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/advanced/\">nearly half of installations</a> running version 1.4. This is a far cry from the 100K active installs <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-new-gutenberg-editor-now-available-as-a-plugin-for-testing\">Mullenweg would like to see</a> before merging it into core.</p>\n<p>I don&#8217;t think advertising Gutenberg in the dashboard to millions of users as the new editing experience should be considered until a merge proposal has been published on the Make Core WordPress site. By this time, many of its quirks and how it handles meta data, meta blocks, and preventing data loss will likely be solved.</p>\n<p>I am one of the people who raised their eyebrows at the idea of advertising Gutenberg at its current stage of development to the masses. My primary concern is that it&#8217;s not ready yet. At the same time, I wonder when or if there is a right or responsible time to advertise installing beta software onto a live site.

When a page is cached almost all of WordPress is skipped and the page is sent to the browser with the minimum amount of code executed. This makes the page load much faster.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately if you want to run code on every page load you&#8217;re out of luck as regular WordPress plugins are not loaded or executed. You&#8217;ll need to write a WP Super Cache plugin. This short introduction will not teach you how to write plugins but the example plugins that ship with WP Super Cache will get you a long way towards understanding how they work.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>WP Super Cache ships with some example plugins in wp-super-cache/plugins/. Some of them even do useful tasks like help with domain mapping and Jetpack integration. There&#8217;s one called &#8220;awaitingmoderation.php&#8221; which removes the text &#8220;Your comment is awaiting moderation.&#8221; when someone writes a moderated comment.<br />\nThere&#8217;s also dynamic-cache-test.php which is a complicated beast but it&#8217;s heavily commented. It allows you to add template tags to your site that are replaced when the cached page is loaded.</p>\n<p>Before you get started writing a plugin you should be aware that you should <em>not</em> use the wp-super-cache/plugins/ directory. Every time WP Super Cache is updated this directory is deleted. So, edit your wp-config.php and set <code>$wp_cache_plugins_dir</code> to another directory where you&#8217;ll put your plugin.</p>\n<p>These plugins run before most of WordPress has loaded. That means you can&#8217;t rely on some of the nice features of WordPress such as filters and actions. However, WP Super Cache has it&#8217;s own action/filter system that is similar to actions and filters in WordPress:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>add_cacheaction( $action, $func )</li>\n<li>do_cacheaction( $action, $value = &#8221; )</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A cacheaction is also a filter. If you hook on to a cache action that has a parameter, you must return that parameter at the end of the function like you would with a WordPress filter.</p>\n<p><img /></p>\n<p>If you need to hook into a WordPress filter use the imaginatively named cache action &#8220;add_cacheaction&#8221;. That runs on &#8220;init&#8221; so the function that is executed can use <code>add_action()</code> or <code>add_filter()</code>. You can see this in action in the plugins/dynamic-cache-test.php or plugins/awaitingmoderation.php scripts.</p>\n<p>Two very useful filters are the WordPress filter, &#8220;wpsupercache_buffer&#8221; (in wp-cache-phase2.php) that is used to modify the page before it is <em>cached</em> and the cache action &#8220;wpsc_cachedata&#8221; (in wp-cache-phase1.php) is used to modify the cached page just before it&#8217;s <em>served</em>.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Related Posts</strong><ul><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2008/10/24/wp-super-cache-084-the-garbage-collector/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector\">WP Super Cache 0.8.4, the garbage collector</a></li><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2010/02/08/wp-super-cache-099/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.9.9\">WP Super Cache 0.9.9</a></li><li> <a href=\"https://odd.blog/2009/07/17/wp-super-cache-0-9-5/\" rel=\"bookmark\" title=\"Permanent Link: WP Super Cache 0.9.5\">WP Super Cache 0.9.5</a></li></ul></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://odd.blog/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Source</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 16:21:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Donncha\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"HeroPress: Paying It Forward\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2217\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:108:\"https://heropress.com/essays/paying-it-forward/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=paying-it-forward\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8173:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102817-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull quote: The spirit of WordPress is paying it forward.\" /><p>I have always embraced an entrepreneurial spirit. As a kid in the 1970’s, I tagged along with my parents to craft shows on the weekends where they made and sold hand-stamped leather belts to earn extra income and I made macrame necklaces and sold those too. When I was 14 I told my dad I wanted to be a stewardess when I grew up, he said “Why not be the pilot? Be the captain!” and gave me some flight lessons for my birthday (I discovered I get air sick very easily, so did not pursue that dream for long!).</p>\n<p>Throughout my childhood and into adulthood, I loved to create things that people would buy from me &#8211; from a lemonade stand when I was 7 to custom-made t-shirts I sold on football weekends in college;</p>\n<blockquote><p>I was always thinking about ways to earn income &#8211; not to get rich, but to have the validation that I created something of value to others.</p></blockquote>\n<h3>Pivoting to Entrepreneurship</h3>\n<p>Fast-forward to a time after my first child was born. My career in advertising and marketing introduced me to tools, techniques and jargon that are still valid today, but “working for the man” was never a truly satisfying experience for me. Thankfully, my husband had a salaried job with benefits, and since he traveled a lot for work, we decided that I would stay home with our son. When I left my marketing job, my boss suggested I start a little business selling illustrated prints I had become known for around the office, having given them as gifts to my co-workers when they had babies.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignleft size-full wp-image-2219\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/growupgirl.gif\" alt=\"Cartoon people holding up letters that spell MORGAN\" width=\"249\" height=\"153\" />With that idea in mind, I started gradually spreading the word among my new “mom” friends, and before I knew it, about 5 years later, with a second child and a wonderful network of moms, I had a full-fledged stationery business, TLC by TARA, that allowed me to work from home and take care of my kids. My income was low, but grew over the years until it covered piano lessons for my children and a car payment on an awesome blue Dodge mini van!</p>\n<blockquote><p>More importantly, this “accidental” career allowed me to broaden my identity and skill set without even intending to.</p></blockquote>\n<p>It introduced me to wonderful friends and fellow entrepreneurs, and satisfied that craving for validation, connection, and a little bit of income.</p>\n<h3>Pivoting to the Web</h3>\n<p>The business began before the internet was “a thing” and before computers were widely used. By 2003, however, I began to explore digital tools and built a website for my business using Microsoft Front Page. I uploaded hundreds of illustrations and laid them out in html tables.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/screenshot_2017-10-10_12.21.58_1024.png\"><img class=\"alignleft wp-image-2218\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/screenshot_2017-10-10_12.21.58_1024.png\" alt=\"Example of design library by Tara Claeys\" width=\"350\" height=\"360\" /></a>I fell in love with technology and eventually decided to stop making stationery. I got rid of my industrial printer, paper cutter, paper, and supplies and changed my business name to Design TLC to focus on graphic and web design. I had heard about WordPress and volunteered to build a new website for my neighborhood association and a local women’s cycling group to check out the platform, practice and learn. I taught myself how to make custom child themes and combined that with my marketing background to create websites for a number of small local businesses.</p>\n<h3>And then WordCamp</h3>\n<p>It wasn’t until 2014 that I discovered the WordPress community. I heard about “WordCamps” and found one near me, in Baltimore, Maryland. By chance I sat at a lunch table with two strangers who I later learned were quite well known in the WordPress world &#8211; Chris Lema and Shay Bocks. They were so friendly and supportive, answering my many questions and offering tips and advice that changed my approach to website design and to running my business. I still think back to that experience as transformative; having lived in a bubble for the first years of working with WordPress, it was eye-opening to discover its community and resources.</p>\n<p>I quickly started absorbing everything I could about WordPress. I live-streamed WordCamp San Francisco in 2014, and joined Slack and Facebook groups. I started listening to a ton of WordPress podcasts and attended WordCamp Philadelphia and WordCamp New York City. I began attending the DC WordPress Meetup, where eventually one of the organizers encouraged me to speak about Genesis for a lightning talk. I couldn’t believe I was suddenly in a position of authority &#8211; sharing my knowledge with others when I felt like everything was still so new to me.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Like many in our community, I am plagued by imposter syndrome.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Relative to many, I am still new to WordPress and I am not a trained coder/programmer. I am also self-consciously older than many people I meet, and still sometimes think of myself as a “Mompreneur.” I am constantly making choices about what to learn next and where to focus my time and resources. Most importantly, I think about how I can run a business while also giving back to the community that has welcomed me and given me so much. I love the mission of HeroPress &#8211; giving a voice to others like me, who may often <em>feel</em> insignificant but whose lives have been inspired and enhanced by the WordPress community.  With this vision in mind, this year Liam Dempsey and I started the podcast Hallway Chats, where we introduce and talk to people who use WordPress. Like HeroPress, we hope these stories inspire someone else who in turn will keep the cycle of sharing and encouragement going!</p>\n<blockquote><p>The spirit of WordPress is “paying it forward” and I think that is the best kind of payment there is.</p></blockquote>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Paying It Forward\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Paying%20It%20Forward&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fpaying-it-forward%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Paying It Forward\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fpaying-it-forward%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fpaying-it-forward%2F&title=Paying+It+Forward\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Paying It Forward\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/paying-it-forward/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/102817-150x150.jpg&description=Paying It Forward\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Paying It Forward\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/paying-it-forward/\" title=\"Paying It Forward\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/paying-it-forward/\">Paying It Forward</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 25 Oct 2017 12:00:23 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Tara Claeys\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 4.9 Beta 4\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4962\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/10/wordpress-4-9-beta-4/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2297:\"<p>WordPress 4.9 Beta 4 is now available!</p>\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site.

Canvas was one of the most innovative themes on the market when it first launched in 2010, giving customers the ability to modify their sites&#8217; design and layout through an extensive options panel. It sold for $99 before the <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/products/canvas/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">product URL</a> was redirected to a retirement page today.</p>\n<p>Canvas&#8217; retirement is a strong signal that Automattic is going all-in on Gutenberg. Without a complete overhaul, the theme is no longer able to keep pace with the changes that Gutenberg and the Customizer will bring to WordPress theming and site building.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While still early, we believe strongly that Gutenberg is the future,&#8221; Canvas lead developer Jeffrey Pearce said. &#8220;We’ve decided to invest our resources in preparing our products for it in order to bring you the best experience. Unfortunately, that won’t include Canvas.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WooCommerce has discontinued Canvas sales and will not be open sourcing the theme to the community.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Overhauling the theme wouldn’t serve our users, yet continuing to sell it as-is wasn’t the right decision. So we made the difficult decision to say goodbye,&#8221; Pearce said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We considered open sourcing Canvas to the community, but ultimately decided that extending its lifetime will not serve the community. It’s in the best interest of our users and the community to eventually move to another theme.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WooCommerce plans to continue supporting active subscriptions and will offer support for lifetime subscriptions for the next year. However, the theme will not be updated to support newer features coming to WordPress. The team strongly urges users to migrate their sites to <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/storefront/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Storefront</a>, the company&#8217;s more mobile-friendly flagship theme built on top of the Underscores starter theme. WooCommerce has published a <a href=\"https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/choose-change-theme/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">migration guide</a> to help customers <a href=\"https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/moving-on-from-canvas/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">move on from Canvas</a>.</p>\n<p>Over the years customers have created many different types of websites (not limited to e-commerce) using Canvas. While some have accepted the inevitable, others are anxious and upset about the change, faced with the prospect of migrating dozens of sites (in many instances) away from the theme. The news of Canvas&#8217; retirement was especially difficult for those who support clients who may not be happy to pay for their existing sites to get updated with no appreciable difference. It&#8217;s not easy to sell the change to clients when most of it happens under the hood.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This puts me in a terrible position,&#8221; WooCommerce customer Leon Wagner said. &#8220;I have 10 client sites on Canvas. They look beautiful and the clients are happy. So these are done deals, I’ve been paid, and do occasional maintenance. Now you’re telling me I have to go back to each of them and explain that because you’re discontinuing this theme, my clients will now have to pay me thousands of dollars to port their sites (with no obvious improvements) to new themes. Pretty sure I’ll just lose most of those clients.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Other freelancers and small business owners find themselves in the same boat, many of them with twice that many clients on the Canvas theme. Although the theme can continue to be used without breaking, it will no longer receive compatibility or security updates after the support window expires in October 2018.

The team has also included a way for users to create posts with the Classic Editor, but this requires knowing where to go to access the dropdown (All Posts &raquo; Add New).</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-24-at-11.12.41-AM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Version 1.5 <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2804\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">adds initial support for meta boxes</a> in an Extended Settings panel beneath the post content. Users won&#8217;t see this bottom panel unless they have a plugin installed that includes meta boxes. The sidebar Settings panel must already be toggled open for the bottom panel to appear.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-24-at-1.04.55-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The Extended Settings panel slides up to reveal accordion toggles for plugins that have meta box settings available. The design could use some improvement, especially for navigating back to the post editor. The panel takes over the entire section. On installations with lots of legacy meta boxes it is easy to get lost in all the open/closed toggles.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-24-at-1.19.36-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Gutenberg design lead Tammie Lister said this is the first step towards supporting meta boxes and that there will be iterations to follow. She also warned that it is possible some advanced meta box uses will not work as expected. The Gutenberg team is eager to receive feedback on these cases and will work to find solutions for them. Testers who discover issues with meta box support can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/new\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">post an issue on GitHub</a> or via the plugin&#8217;s feedback form, describing the setup and how to reproduce what is breaking.</p>\n<p>Version 1.5 also adds <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/3008\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a new inserter button between blocks</a>, which Gutenberg engineer Matias Ventura demonstrated with an animated gif in the release post:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/gutenberg-insert-between.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>This release <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/2887\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">adds a dropdown to the Publish button</a>. It currently supports visibility and post scheduling features.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-24-at-2.25.58-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>There was a great deal of discussion on GitHub surrounding the UI for the publish button, whether it should be a split button dropdown or a single button that provides slightly more friction to prevent accidental publishing. The general consensus was that introducing a bit more friction is desirable, as contributor Davide Casali noted there are many cascading actions that are often tied to the Publish button:</p>\n<p>&#8220;Some automated publishing actions are irreversible: pings gets sent, emails get sent, Facebook and Twitter gets updates, etc.,&#8221; Casali said. &#8220;This is very very important for a lot of people and businesses, and nobody wants to send out such actions by accident.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Contributors are looking for feedback on this implementation and are willing to explore some alternate design options as well. They agreed that it is more important to make the Publish button area pluggable and to work on adapting it based on feedback.</p>\n<p>For those who want to completely disable Gutenberg, a new plugin called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Classic Editor</a> is available on WordPress.org and ready for testing. It requires WordPress 4.9-beta2 or newer and Gutenberg version 1.5+. Classic Editor comes with two modes that give users the option to fully replace Gutenberg or allow access to both the old and new editors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Fully replaces the Gutenberg editor and restores the Edit Post template.</li>\n<li>Adds alternate “Edit” links to the Posts and Pages screens, on the toolbar at the top of the screen, and in the admin menu. Using these links will open the corresponding post or page in the Classic Editor.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A setting for switching between the modes is available at Settings &raquo; Writing. Other plugins for turning Gutenberg off will likely pop up the closer the it gets to being included in core, but Classic Editor is the official one recommended by core contributors.</p>\n<p>The timeline for the merge proposal is not yet set in stone but the Gutenberg team aims to get it more widely tested before writing the proposal. The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">plugin</a> is currently active on approximately 3,000 WordPress sites.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The plan is to still have the plugin ready by December, but with holidays the actual merge proposal might be next year,&#8221; Tammie Lister said. &#8220;It’s important that we get as many users and as much feedback as possible at this point. All of that impacts what happens going forward.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 24 Oct 2017 20:51:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:32;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"WPTavern: Facebook is Testing a “Pay to Play” Requirement for Publishers in the News Feed\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=75950\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"https://wptavern.com/facebook-is-testing-a-pay-to-play-requirement-for-publishers-in-the-news-feed\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3179:\"<p>Last week Facebook began rolling out its new <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/explore\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Explore feed</a>, which is now available for users globally on both desktop and mobile. The new Explore feed encourages discovery by including posts from people and pages that the user doesn&#8217;t follow.</p>\n<p>Over the weekend, Filip Struhárik, a journalist and editor at <a href=\"https://dennikn.sk/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Denník N</a>, published data from sixty of the largest Slovak media pages that have experienced a <a href=\"https://medium.com/@filip_struharik/biggest-drop-in-organic-reach-weve-ever-seen-b2239323413\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">dramatic decrease in organic reach</a> as the result of Facebook moving Pages from the News feed into the Explore feed. Facebook representatives said this is a regional test the company is conducting in six smaller markets, including Bolivia, Cambodia, Guatemala, Serbia, Slovakia, and Sri Lanka. The main News feed in these areas includes only posts from friends and sponsors.</p>\n<p>Struhárik shared a chart that shows Slovak media pages having received 4x fewer interactions (likes, comments, shares) since the test began:</p>\n<a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/slovak-media-pages.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a>Interactions on 60 of the largest Slovak media Facebook pages &#8211; Source: CrowdTangle\n<p>Adam Mosseri, head of News Feed at Facebook, has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mosseri/status/922521929277497346\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed</a> that the experiment is limited to the six countries and the company does not plan to take roll it out globally.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not global and there are no plans to be,&#8221; Mosseri said. &#8220;People often tell us they want more from friends so we&#8217;re testing two feeds, one for friend content and another dedicated to page content.&#8221;</p>\n<p>When asked how long the experiment will last, Mosseri said, &#8220;Likely months as it can take that long for people to adapt, but we&#8217;ll be looking to improve the experience in the meantime.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, the test has had a dramatic impact on traffic to publishers in the six markets where it is currently active. It has also given the rest of the world a preview of what a new &#8220;pay to play&#8221; requirement for Facebook&#8217;s main News feed might look like in the future.</p>\n<p>Limiting the main News feed to posts from friends and family and relocating content from Pages to the Explore feed would be a welcome change for users but bad news for publishers that depend on Facebook to drive referrals. The News Feed has increasingly become a never-ending pile of clickbait posts and ads that users have to sift through in order to see any meaningful content from friends.</p>\n<p>Pages and publishers have had to become highly active in marketing their content to compete with advertising. If Facebook&#8217;s split feed experiments turn out to be a success, publishers may need to allocate more resources to their advertising budgets if they want to maintain the same reach on the social network.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 23 Oct 2017 22:33:41 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:33;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:89:\"WPTavern: Postman SMTP Plugin Forked after Removal from WordPress.org for Security Issues\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=75870\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"https://wptavern.com/postman-smtp-plugin-forked-after-removal-from-wordpress-org-for-security-issues\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3997:\"<a href=\"https://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/post.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: <a href=\"https://stocksnap.io/photo/MSJNQ4EHZ2\">Jerry Kiesewetter</a>\n<p>In early October the popular <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/postman-smtp/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Postman SMTP</a> plugin was removed from WordPress.org due to security issues. The plugin had not been updated in two years and also contained <a href=\"https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2017/06/29/reflected-cross-site-scripting-xss-vulnerability-in-postman-smtp/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability</a> that was made public in June and left unfixed. The security researcher&#8217;s attempts to contact the plugin&#8217;s author, Jason Hendriks, were unsuccessful.</p>\n<p>The plugin is used to improve the delivery of emails that WordPress generates and it logs the causes of failed emails to help eliminate configuration mistakes. It was installed on more than 100,000 sites before it was removed from WordPress.org.</p>\n<p>Yehuda Hassine, a WordPress developer and longtime user of the plugin, decided to fork it for the sake of its users and because he thought it was a shame to see all the the original author&#8217;s hard work go to waste.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As a fan of the amazing work Jason has done, I was amazed no one thought of taking it over,&#8221; Hassine said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a great plugin &#8211; Jason solved so many problems dealing with SMTP setup in WordPress. He worked so hard and the idea it might disappear shocked me. The plugin worked with almost zero bugs for the past two years.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hassine&#8217;s fork <a href=\"https://github.com/yehudah/Postman-SMTP\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">started on GitHub</a> with fixes for the security issue, but he said he realized not having it on WordPress.org might be a problem for some users. He submitted it under a new name, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-smtp/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Post SMTP Mailer/Email Log</a>, and included a patch for the security vulnerability along with fixes for a few bugs with the Gmail API, Mandrill, and SendGrid. The next item on his roadmap is to fix a few issues with PHP 7 compatibility.</p>\n<p>Hassine also requested to adopt the original plugin, as there is no way to contact the 100,000 users who depend on it. He said the WordPress.org plugin team denied his request at this time due to the number of users and his relative unfamiliarity in the community, as well as to give the original author more time to respond.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/post-smtp\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Post SMTP Mailer/Email Log</a> fork has been alive for a week and already has more than 1,000 users. Hassine said he is spending his free time getting to know the SMTP protocol and Hendriks&#8217; original code. Postman SMTP users who want to switch to the fork can keep the same settings by simply deactivating the old plugin and activating the new one.</p>\n<p>Hassine has committed to keeping the plugin free, as many of its users are somewhat technical and able to offer each other support. He said if the fork becomes popular and more difficult to maintain, he will consider a commercial model for support.</p>\n<p>Users of the original Postman SMTP plugin had no way of learning about the reasons behind its disappearance except on third-party sites like the Wordfence blog or Facebook posts. The WordPress.org Meta team is currently working on <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2627\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">developing a better way to communicate</a> why certain plugins have been closed or removed from the directory.

It will be the first time a Camp Press event will be held in Europe.</p>\n<p>The Camp Press organization was founded to help attendees detox from digital life while spending time in nature and connecting with others in similar industries. It just wrapped up its first successful event in Oklahoma last month and the next planned event will be held in <a href=\"https://camp.press/event/camp-press-lonestar-2018/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Austin, Texas on the San Marcos River</a>, February 23-25, 2018. In a guest <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/camp-press-a-detox-from-digital-life\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> on the Tavern, Brad Williams, an attendee at the inaugural event, described how the unstructured, unplugged time led to deeper connections:</p>\n<blockquote><p>As we learned more about each other, we quickly became more comfortable as a group. We shared stories, laughed, cooked, and debated topics from tech to TV shows. We discussed very personal struggles and experiences, some of which I would guess haven’t been shared outside of close family. We sang songs around the campfire, performed late-night improv, made s’mores, and enjoyed each other’s company.</p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://camp.press/event/camp-press-adventure-series/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Camp Press Iceland</a> will include four days off-the-grid with the opportunity for hikes, campfires, swimming in a geothermal swimming hole, and tours of the area with minimal scheduling. Camp Press co-organizer Mendel Kurland said they chose the venue in Iceland because many people have the location on their bucket lists.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Helping geeks detox from technology and their job is important for mental health and their ability to get things done on a daily basis,&#8221; Kurland said. &#8220;Many of us also don&#8217;t want to completely let go of talking about tech, business, or what we&#8217;re working on. This gives people a chance to disconnect with other people who understand them, while marking an item off their bucket list.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Camp Press events are different from WordCamps in that they are for-profit events. In addition to ticket sales, the organization also accepts sponsorships on a per-event and annual basis. Pantheon, Dreamhost, and WPEngine joined as founding sponsors for the first event. Kurland said currently no money leaves the coffers to pay for the organizers&#8217; time and all money earned is re-invested back into the concept for hosting future events.</p>\n<p>Camp Press is also different in that it is a completely independent organization. Kurland and his co-organizers borrowed from both the WordCamp and Burning Man codes of conduct to create a <a href=\"https://camp.press/code-of-conduct/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">code for Camp Press</a> that minimizes commercial interests and emphasizes inclusion, self-expression, and civic responsibility.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve learned a lot from other organizers of WordCamps across the world &#8211; the struggles, the excitement, the fulfillment they enjoy,&#8221; Kurland said. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t consider the WordCamp model or foundation for this project. Independence from community politics is essential for this type of event. It&#8217;s important to have a separate objective space for connection and something that bridges between multiple communities as opposed to connected to one.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Kurland said this type of event excels in bringing together people from different professional backgrounds and ecosystems to collaborate.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Half are WordPress people, half aren&#8217;t,&#8221; he said. &#8220;So the opportunity to cross-pollinate and bring back awesome insights that are broader than your bubble is huge. There are a few ways this event bucks the trend. Right now we&#8217;re 60% female and 40% male for registration on the Iceland event.&#8221; The previous event hosted attendees from various professions, including graphic artists, authors, developers, and product company owners.</p>\n<p>Kurland said the Camp Press organization plans to offer a few more domestic US event this year, along with one or two European events. They are also planning on running trips to other exotic destinations in the future. Based on the demand the organizers have seen, they anticipate a lot of interest in future events and are considering hosting interest-focused camps.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Camp Press events will always be accessible to most and have enough activities to accommodate many interests,&#8221; Kurland said. &#8220;The next step will probably be helping companies to build out awesome experiences to gain deep insights regarding their team or client dynamics with this same type of event. We have also considered building experiences around other communities, i.e. doctors, scientists, teachers &#8211; people who need a break and have high stress jobs, but find it hard to disconnect.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite not being paid for his efforts in organizing the Camp Press events, Kurland said he finds a lot of personal fulfillment in participating that keeps him wanting to organize more in the future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I need disconnection as much as the participants,&#8221; Kurland said. &#8220;So, for me, I get excited thinking about disconnecting and helping others shed their phone and laptop for a few days. It&#8217;s what has driven me to create these events, and I don&#8217;t see that drive dulling anytime soon.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 20 Oct 2017 22:14:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"HeroPress: Accepting Donations\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://heropress.com/?p=2179\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"https://heropress.com/accepting-donations/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=accepting-donations\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3609:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"560\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/icons_logo_overlay-1024x597.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"HeroPress Logo laid over icons of contributors\" /><p>Over the years people have occasionally said, “You should have a donation form; I’d like to help support HeroPress”. Recently a particularly deep conversation convinced me that allowing people to take part financially is a different, broader way for others to contribute to HeroPress.</p>\n<p>Since HeroPress doesn’t exist without its contributors, I consulted them first and got a universal, resounding, “YES!”.</p>\n<p>So as of today you’ll find a “Donate” button in the menu at the top of the site.</p>\n<h3>What will donations be used for?</h3>\n<p>I’m glad you asked! A variety of things.</p>\n<p>First, I’ll have resources to sink back into the project. Hosting has been donated, but I’d like to be able to do things like pay Stacey to make banners for the older essays that don’t have them, continue to pay her to make new banners each week, and some other things similar to that.</p>\n<p>Second, I’d like to be able to visit WordCamps on behalf of HeroPress. Donations would allow me to set aside money to travel either to camps I’ve been invited to by previous contributors or to new areas and introduce them to the project.</p>\n<p>Lastly, it helps cover my time spent on HeroPress. This project is (and will continue to be) a labor of love, but it still eats up about 5 hours of my week that I’m not spending with my family. While the project isn’t in danger of disappearing, donations simply help share the weight of the project.</p>\n<h3>Where can I Give?</h3>\n<h2><a href=\"https://heropress.com/give/\">Right Here</a></h2>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Accepting Donations\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Accepting%20Donations&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Faccepting-donations%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Accepting Donations\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Faccepting-donations%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Faccepting-donations%2F&title=Accepting+Donations\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Accepting Donations\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/accepting-donations/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/icons_logo_overlay-150x150.jpg&description=Accepting Donations\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Accepting Donations\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/accepting-donations/\" title=\"Accepting Donations\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/accepting-donations/\">Accepting Donations</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 20 Oct 2017 12:00:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: From Building WordPress Sites to Selling Plugins in One Year\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=75888\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:81:\"https://wptavern.com/from-building-wordpress-sites-to-selling-plugins-in-one-year\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13261:\"<img />Katie Keith\n<p>This is a guest post written by <span class=\"st\"><a href=\"https://barn2.co.uk/team/katie-keith/\">Katie Keith</a>, co-founder of <a href=\"https://barn2.co.uk/\">Barn2 Media</a>. In this post, Keith shares the lessons she and her husband learned transitioning from client work to selling WordPress products in one year.<br />\n</span></p>\n<hr />\n<p>If you’ve ever dreamed of quitting client work and earning passive income by selling WordPress themes and plugins, you’re not alone. Selling products instead of providing services is the holy grail for many WordPress professionals.</p>\n<p>This is the story of how I switched from building websites to selling plugins in just one year. Along the way, I’ve made a lot of mistakes and learned some valuable lessons. Here’s how you can make the switch too.</p>\n<h2>Seven Years Building WordPress Websites</h2>\n<p>I co-founded UK WordPress studio Barn2 Media in late 2009 with my husband Andy. We had always wanted to work for ourselves, and felt that web design was the perfect way to combine our skills. (His background is in web development; mine is project management and marketing.)</p>\n<p>For the next seven years, we built the business by designing WordPress websites for clients, both in the UK and worldwide. We were successful and always had more work than we needed. However, from very early on, we both aspired to sell our own products instead of building websites for other people.</p>\n<h2>Our Transition Into A Plugin Business</h2>\n<p>Working with clients is great, and you get to know a lot of interesting people from different walks of life. But as a business owner, I found it frustrating to spend all of my time helping other people to build their business, with very little time to develop my own. I wanted to run a business where I could reap the rewards of my hard work. And that’s where products come in!</p>\n<p>In the early days of the business, we tried launching a few products in our spare time, without success. In 2016, we committed to transforming Barn2 Media into a premium plugins company.</p>\n<p>Within three months, we had launched two free plugins and a paid one. Within six months of our product focus, we were able to stop accepting new client work. Within a year, we had five premium plugins. Income from the plugin business overtook the original client business, and we haven’t looked back since.</p>\n<img />Plugin Sales Report\n<h2>Lesson #1: Commit by Any Means Necessary</h2>\n<p>A lot of WordPress professionals try to develop themes or plugins as a side business, alongside their client projects. Some have found success that way, but it’s much more difficult. I tried this in 2012-13, and failed miserably.</p>\n<p>In 2012, the WordPress themes industry was less mature and some fairly simple themes were seeing huge success. We wanted a piece of the pie, and started building a simple multipurpose theme.</p>\n<p>The reality of day-to-day client work made it difficult to commit much time to the theme. Before we knew it, a year had passed before we were ready to submit it to ThemeForest (our chosen marketplace due to the easy route to market). By then, the themes industry had changed and was dominated by much more advanced themes that we didn’t have the resources to compete with. The market had moved on, leaving us behind.</p>\n<p>When we started building plugins in early 2016, we learned from this mistake. Andy stopped designing websites for clients, and focused 100% on the plugins. I continued with some client projects, but dedicated 50% of my time to marketing.</p>\n<p>It was scary to intentionally limit our income by turning down client work &#8211; especially when there are bills for pay. Fortunately, the extra commitment was worth it. We made excellent progress and got our plugins to market quickly. This made all of the difference.</p>\n<p>If you want to build a successful theme or plugins business, commit as much time as possible to it &#8211; even if it means a short-term drop in income. You may still need to do some client work to pay the bills, but do the absolute minimum and don’t be afraid to say <strong>No</strong>. This will make you much likelier to succeed.</p>\n<h2>Lesson #2 &#8211; Go Niche, and Avoid Marketplace Fees</h2>\n<p>When we were developing a theme, we planned to sell it on ThemeForest because we’d struggle to achieve the same level of exposure ourselves. We knew we’d have to give away a huge percentage of our income in commission, but figured that it’s better to have a 50% of something than 100% of nothing.</p>\n<p>Since then, I’ve learned that you can have your cake and eat it too. The trick is to create niche products where you have a reasonable chance of getting the exposure you need.</p>\n<p>To illustrate this point, let’s look at our first plugin &#8211; <a href=\"https://barn2.co.uk/wordpress-plugins/woocommerce-password-protected-categories/\">WooCommerce Password Protected Categories</a>. It solves a very specific problem, and is about as niche as you can get! We could have sold it on a marketplace such as CodeCanyon, who would have priced it at about $25. After commission, we’d have received $12.50-$17.50 per sale.</p>\n<p>Instead, we decided to sell the plugin directly on our own website. After researching the cost of similar plugins, we set the price at $75.</p>\n<p>With those costs, it would only be worth using a marketplace if it would get 500% more sales. However, ‘WooCommerce password protected categories’ is a very niche keyword and quickly reached number one in Google.</p>\n<p>This put it directly in front of people who were looking for this solution. When I compare our sales figures with other plugins on CodeCanyon, I’m confident that we’ve had just as many sales from selling direct &#8211; with much higher revenue and profit margin.</p>\n<p>If you’re switching to plugin sales and don’t have a huge marketing budget, do your research and create niche plugins to meet a specific need. The WordPress market is so huge that there are plenty of people looking for solutions &#8211; even very niche ones.</p>\n<h2>Lesson #3 &#8211; Get Ideas From Your Clients</h2>\n<p>As a client-facing WordPress company, you’re in a unique position to know what your clients want. When a client requests a new feature for their website, you probably research suitable plugins. If you’ve ever failed to find a suitable plugin, you’ve found a potential gap in the market!</p>\n<p>This is how we ended up with our bestselling plugin. A client wanted a table listing all of their blog posts. We didn’t find any WordPress table plugins that could do this dynamically, so we developed a bespoke plugin for the client. Later, we released an <a href=\"https://en-gb.wordpress.org/plugins/posts-data-table/\">enhanced version</a> to the WordPress plugin repository.</p>\n<p>After launching the free table plugin, we immediately started getting requests from users wanting to list other WordPress post types in a table. We launched <a href=\"https://barn2.co.uk/wordpress-plugins/posts-table-pro/\">Posts Table Pro</a> as a premium plugin to solve this problem.</p>\n<p>Posts Table Pro was (and still is) quite popular, but we quickly discovered that a lot of our customers were using it to list WooCommerce products in a table. We received lots of requests for dedicated WooCommerce features such as Add to Cart buttons. In response, we developed <a href=\"https://barn2.co.uk/wordpress-plugins/woocommerce-product-table/\">WooCommerce Product Table</a> which has been hugely successful.</p>\n<img />Plugin Ideas\n<p>We never came up with the idea for a WooCommerce table plugin. It was a gradual journey that started with an unrelated request from a client.</p>\n<p>You can do the same. Use your web design clients as a starting point for finding gaps in the market. Go with the flow and evolve new ideas wherever you see demand. If you’re flexible, you can eventually end up with a bestselling plugin!</p>\n<h2>Lesson #4 &#8211; Focus on Professionalism</h2>\n<p>However good your plugins are, they will only sell if people trust you and are confident in buying from you. This is easy if you’re a big name and have a known brand. Unfortunately, we didn’t have those luxuries!</p>\n<p>Barn2 Media is well-known as a WordPress agency, but not as a plugin company. We had to work hard to reassure customers that we’re a professional company that they can safely buy from.</p>\n<p>Here’s how you can do the same:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensure your overall website is professional and has the attention to detail that people will expect from your products.</li>\n<li>Add extra trust factors to your website, such as badges and logos.</li>\n<li>Create well designed sales pages with plenty of information such as screenshots and demo videos.</li>\n<li>Show customer reviews on the sales page. To get started, add a testimonial from one of your web design clients. Once more people are using your product, you can replace it with a full reviews section.</li>\n<li>Design a comprehensive demo site for your themes or plugins.</li>\n<li>Use well-known payment providers.</li>\n<li>Add an <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/more-than-50-of-web-traffic-is-now-encrypted\">SSL certificate</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These details definitely make a difference. Every time we’ve taken steps to make our website more professional, we’ve seen a big jump in sales. A lot of small theme and plugin companies fall at this hurdle and their products get lost behind an unprofessional website &#8211; don’t let the same happen to you.</p>\n<h2>Lesson #5 &#8211; Don’t Let Customer Support Overwhelm You<i></i></h2>\n<img />photo credit: <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ironrodart/4154904299/\">IronRodArt &#8211; Royce Bair (&#8220;Star Shooter&#8221;)</a> &#8211; <a href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/\">cc</a>\n<p>One of my biggest fears in switching to plugin sales was that customer support would be just as time-consuming as supporting clients. In our first few months of selling plugins, every sale seemed to demand a large amount of support. We couldn’t imagine how we would cope with a big increase in sales.</p>\n<p>We overcame this by designing every part of the plugin business in a way that would reduce the need for support:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Build a searchable knowledge library for your documentation and FAQ’s. Make sure customers can only see the ‘Request Support’ link <i>after</i> searching the knowledge library.</li>\n<li>Create a confirmation email with clear setup instructions and links to the knowledge base.</li>\n<li>Add explanatory notes and links to the documentation to your settings pages.</li>\n<li>View every support request as a learning opportunity. How can you prevent other customers from asking the same question in future?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s vital to provide excellent customer support, whether you do it yourself or outsource it. But there’s nothing wrong with helping customers to help themselves, so they’re unlikely to contact you in the first place. This lets us provide better support, build direct relationships with our customers, and constantly improve our plugins and documentation to reduce the need for support even further.</p>\n<p>We originally thought that we’d have to outsource plugin support. In the end, we managed to scale the plugin business to 200+ sales per month while still only spending an hour or two a day on support.</p>\n<h2>Lesson #6 &#8211; Your Old Clients Are A Safety Net, Not A Burden</h2>\n<p>If you’ve been designing websites for a while, then you probably have quite a few existing clients under your belt. It’s easy to see them as a distraction when you’re trying to focus on new goals. Instead, view them as an extra income stream that will provide financial security through your leap into the unknown.</p>\n<p>We host and maintain over 70 websites that we previously developed. We stopped taking on new clients over a year ago, but still take care of our original clients. This doesn’t take much of our time because the hosting and maintenance arrangements are already in place, and it’s easy to make small changes to websites we built ourselves.</p>\n<p>These websites were a lot of work to develop, but now provide a vital stream of passive income. This allowed us to stop taking on new clients more quickly while the income from the plugin business played catch-up. It’s also a safety net in case the plugin industry takes a downturn in the future.</p>\n<h2>Putting It Into Practice</h2>\n<p>After dreaming about it for so many years, I’m so proud that we finally made the transition from designing websites to selling plugins. It wasn’t easy, but when we fully committed to switching to plugins, everything came together and we haven’t looked back.</p>\n<p>When you’re <i>focused</i> on client projects, it’s hard to rise above the day-to-day grind and prioritize product development. Many people have written about the difficulties of starting a theme or plugin business, given the amount of competition and the maturity of the market. By following the lessons in this article, I believe that you can create a space for yourself and find the success you deserve.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 20 Oct 2017 05:08:26 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"WPTavern: AMP Project Turns 2,  Automattic Partners with Google to Improve WordPress Plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=75859\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"https://wptavern.com/amp-project-turns-2-automattic-partners-with-google-to-improve-wordpress-plugin\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8308:\"<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-19-at-1.50.42-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.ampproject.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AMP</a> (Accelerated Mobile Pages) project is two years old today and the company published <a href=\"https://amphtml.wordpress.com/2017/10/19/amp-two-years-of-user-first-webpages/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">data</a> demonstrating its growing adoption across the web. More than 4 billion AMP pages have been published by 25 million domains. AMP performance has also increased and Google reports that the median time for loading AMP pages from its search engine is less than half a second.</p>\n<p>The AMP team also cited several examples of success for sites that have integrated AMP, along with an as yet unpublished Forrester Consulting Total Economic Impact<img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/2122.png\" alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> study that linked AMP to a 10% increase in website traffic and a 2X increase in time spent on the page. The study, which was commissioned by Google, also showed that AMP pages on e-commerce sites have a 20% increase in sales conversions as compared to non-AMP pages.</p>\n<p>Google credited AMP&#8217;s 400+ code contributors and the 10,500 others who have engaged on GiHub, along with <a href=\"https://automattic.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Automattic</a>, one of the earliest publishing partners on the project:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We’re also seeing other organizations take an increasingly proactive role in supporting AMP. Automattic, for example, has been working with us to improve the quality of the WordPress plug-in over the past several months. In addition to strong adoption across the community, WordPress.com VIP clients like <a href=\"https://vip.wordpress.com/2017/10/19/happy-second-birthday-amp/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The New York Post and PMC have seen great results</a> with their implementations.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress.com&#8217;s VIP team also <a href=\"https://vip.wordpress.com/2017/10/19/happy-second-birthday-amp/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">published</a> specific instances where their clients have benefited from AMPing up their articles.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Across Automattic (including WordPress.com and VIP) hundreds of millions of client page views per month are delivered through AMP today,&#8221; WordPress.com VIP Strategic Partnerships director Tamara Sanderson said. &#8220;Over the last two years, many of our clients and partner agencies have customized and optimized the AMP experience for their particular needs, with impressive results.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>AMP WordPress Plugin Updated after 10 Months</h3>\n<p>Automattic updated its <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">AMP WordPress plugin</a> two months ago, but the average WordPress site owner doesn&#8217;t have the budget to customize and tweak it to achieve success. Users haven&#8217;t fared well with the open source plugin, which went for approximately 10 months without any updates. Many have encountered difficulties ranging from activation errors to  incompatibilities with other plugins, problems with analytics, and validation errors. Users also cannot get support on the WordPress.org forums and 0/39 support issues have been resolved in the past two months.</p>\n<p>Although there are several alternative plugins in the directory for implementing AMP on WordPress sites, Automattic, as a partner with Google on the AMP initiative, seems to the best positioned to author the official plugin with the company&#8217;s experience AMPing up pages at scale. Automattic is still committed to improving the plugin but users may need to hire a professional developer for AMP-related plugin support.</p>\n<p>Version 0.5, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/amp/#developers\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">released in August 2017</a>, included just a handful of updates for having been 10 months in development. The release brought the plugin closer to the AMP spec, replaced fastimage with fasterimage for PHP 5.4+, and added support for new embed handlers, including Vimeo, SoundCloud, and Pinterest.</p>\n<h3>Automattic Aims to Work with Google to Push AMP to be more Open</h3>\n<p>Throughout the past year, AMP has come under fire from critics who believe that it is harmful to the open web. By default AMP forces users to load JavaScript from the AMP project site, loads the cached content from its own servers, and uses a subset of HTML that optimizes pages to benefit Google and Google search users.</p>\n<p>Many critics take issue with the fact that Google is incentivizing AMP&#8217;s use by prioritizing AMP pages in search results. It&#8217;s easy to forget that Google Search, with its overwhelmingly dominant market share among search engines, is not a public service to the world. It&#8217;s a company that seeks to make a profit. Can the AMP project be open enough to stay immune to Google&#8217;s drive for profit?</p>\n<p>WordPress.com was one of the first publishers to partner with Google on this initiative to speed up the mobile web. While attending WordCamp Europe 2017, I asked Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg how AMP can be good for the open web, despite how much control publishers are required to yield when it comes to their mobile content. Mullenweg said that he sees pluses and minuses in what AMP currently provides to users.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The things I like about AMP is it removes a lot of cruft and it’s ultra-fast,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now if I see an AMP link I’m more likely to click on that than other things. I know I’m not going to get some weird popup that redirects my browser to the app store or anything like that. I think that is good and necessary.&#8221; He also said he disliked a few of the downsides that critics bring up but thinks that those can be worked out in time.</p>\n<p>“WordPress was very early in adopting responsive pages,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Also some plugins, including Jetpack, that do a mobile version of a site, do create a better experience and are a big reason why people have adopted WordPress in the past.</p>\n<p>&#8220;AMP is the next version of that. It is more open and standard than what we’ve done in the past and I could see it becoming a much more inclusive thing than it is. Given that that is one of Automattic’s core principles as well, we’re going to work with Google to try to push it that direction and try to bring a lot of the web along with it.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The alternatives out there, like say Facebook’s proprietary Instant Articles format, are not necessarily better, especially if they tie you into one form of monetization, like Facebook’s ads. So I do believe that AMP has the potential to be much more open and in line with WordPress’ ideal version of that, but it is imperfect as it stands today.”</p>\n<p>For now it seems Google considers AMP to be a success, as adoption has increased and the project is undoubtedly achieving its goal of improving performance for mobile pages. The company is working on delivering better, faster ads to users, as many publishers have experienced <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/publishers-find-google-amp-loads-fast-ad-views/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">decreased revenues associated with ads loading much slower than the actual content</a>.</p>\n<p>The project is still young and Google has a fine line to walk in order to deliver value without overstepping its reach. It may not be long before AMP support becomes Google&#8217;s the next official ranking signal. Site speed is already one of the search engine&#8217;s considerations in delivering traffic, so AMPed pages already influence which sites are featured in search results, which in turn affects ad performance and site monetization.</p>\n<p>For the average WordPress site owner, adding AMP support still requires overcoming a number of technical hurdles. With Automattic committed to supporting and improving the AMP experience for its VIP clients, it should not be long before the larger publishers and their agency partners are able to iron out more of the difficulties that have kept AMP integration from being seamless for all WordPress users.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 19 Oct 2017 23:54:16 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"WPTavern: WooCommerce Stores on Track to Surpass $10B in Sales This Year\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=75861\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:82:\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-stores-on-track-to-surpass-10b-in-sales-this-year\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4585:\"<p>The third annual <a href=\"https://wooconf.com/\">WooConf</a>, the official conference for <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/\">WooCommerce</a>, is underway today. It started off with a keynote by Todd Wilkens, Head of WooCommerce, providing an overview of the project&#8217;s accomplishments over the past year and a preview of what&#8217;s to come.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/wooconf?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#wooconf</a> — <a href=\"https://twitter.com/WooCommerce?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@woocommerce</a> <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f60a.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f44d.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> <a href=\"https://t.co/8l07LgLd1y\">pic.twitter.com/8l07LgLd1y</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; John Kent (@johnkentsf) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnkentsf/status/921054095120756737?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 19, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>When the crowd was asked to guess how much in sales WooCommerce stores would generate this year, guesses ranged from $10M to $1B. According to Wilkens, WooCommerce stores will collectively generate more than $10B in sales this year and says the figure could be as high as $15B. WooCommerce extension sales are expected to generate more than $30M.</p>\n<p>Wilkens thanked and acknowledged <a href=\"https://github.com/woocommerce/woocommerce/graphs/contributors\">the 616 contributors</a> working on the platform. He then outlined three distinct user segments the company is catering too: store builders, store owners, and extension developers. These user segments are causing the company to reorganize internally and are providing the focus for features going forward.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce is used by a lot of small-to-medium sized businesses but it&#8217;s also used by businesses that generate $100M or more per year. Wilkens profiled <a href=\"https://www.heb.com/\">H-E-B</a>, a large grocery retailer in Texas that uses WooCommerce for its sister company, <a href=\"http://centralmarket.com/\">Central Market</a>. WebDevStudios <a href=\"https://webdevstudios.com/portfolio/central-market/\">built the site</a> on WordPress and used WooCommerce to handle the company&#8217;s eCommerce needs.</p>\n<h2>Coming to A WooCommerce Near You</h2>\n<p>WooCommerce is making investments into its design and user experience with the insight of <a href=\"https://design.blog/2016/08/08/john-maeda/\">John Maeda</a>, the company&#8217;s Global Head of Computational Design and Inclusion. The company is also investing in user research, testing, interviews, feedback, and doing what they can to learn about its users needs.</p>\n<p>He acknowledged the hiccups users encountered when upgrading <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-3-0-brings-major-improvements-to-product-gallery-introduces-crud-classes-and-a-new-cli\">sites to WooCommerce 3.0</a> earlier this year and says the experience has placed a heavier emphasis to establish a reliable upgrade and maintenance path.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce will combine its affiliate program with WordPress.com so that everything is managed under one roof. As WooCommerce has improved, it has also developed closer ties to Jetpack and WordPress.com in order to provide additional services.</p>\n<p>Automattic has years of experience building and maintaining SaaS infrastructures. Instead of creating a separate infrastructure for WooCommerce, the team decided to leverage Automattic&#8217;s infrastructure with Jetpack. We&#8217;ll publish more about this relationship in a future article.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce will revamp its mobile application and is opening its marketplace to extension authors. Extension authors can expect higher commissions, more control, and better access to their customers. Authors will also be able to provide support to their own customers on the site.</p>\n<p>Earlier this year, WooCommerce <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-drops-50-renewal-discount-on-subscriptions\">dropped its 50% renewal discount</a> forcing customers to pay full-price without explicitly notifying them. Near the end of keynote, Wilkens provided context for the move saying it was about sustainability. Although comments on the article indicated that many customers were upset with the change, Wilkens says it has proven to be successful and has led to a substantial improvement in customer support.</p>\n<p>Those involved in the WooCommerce ecosystem can expect to see many more changes to both the website and platform in the coming months.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 19 Oct 2017 22:30:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Jeff Chandler\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 4.9 Beta 3\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4953\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/10/wordpress-4-9-beta-3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3430:\"<p>WordPress 4.9 Beta 3 is now available!</p>\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site.

Microsoft is calling it &#8220;the biggest enhancement to OpenType since the OpenType specification was first released nineteen years ago.&#8221; The company&#8217;s announcement, published in 2016, describes a few of the most important advantages of OpenType Variable Fonts:</p>\n<blockquote><p>OpenType Font Variations enables web site designers and application developers to deliver typographically rich experiences while using very little network bandwidth and small font files. Variable fonts will also give document creators a broad palette of typographic features without having to manage hundreds of font files. Variable fonts are all about doing more with less.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Last year, after OpenType Font Variations were added to version 1.8 of the OpenType font format specification, <a href=\"http://www.tiro.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Tiro Typeworks</a> co-founder John Hudson wrote an excellent <a href=\"https://medium.com/@tiro/https-medium-com-tiro-introducing-opentype-variable-fonts-12ba6cd2369\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> explaining how variable fonts work and their potential impact on typography in the future:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The potential for dynamic selection of custom instances within the variations design space — or design-variations space, to use its technical name — opens exciting prospects for fine tuning the typographic palette, and for new kinds of responsive typography that can adapt to best present dynamic content to a reader’s device, screen orientation, or even reading distance.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Variable fonts are currently in development for Microsoft Edge and the team is also working on a <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/css-fonts-3/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">formal proposal to add support to CSS</a>.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Just submitted the PR, should be live on the status site soon.

Although GoDaddy currently has 4 million customers running on WordPress, its more basic plans were not adequate for those who require additional tools to manage multiple sites and clients in one place.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our new Managed WordPress platform is for WordPress professionals, which we’ve struggled to serve well in the past,&#8221;    GoDaddy&#8217;s Head of WordPress, Gabriel Mays, said. &#8220;We’re fixing that.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Pro WordPress, a product the company teased at WordCamp Europe 2017, uses PHP 7.1 as the default, Kubernetes container management, and gives each site isolated, dedicated resources. It also includes ManageWP premium tools (<a href=\"https://www.godaddy.com/pro/managewp?isc=cardigan\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GoDaddy Pro Sites</a>), 90 days of backups powered by ManageWP, staging site environment, a Gravity Forms license, a library of 10,000+ free stock images, scanning and monitoring powered by Sucuri, and free SSL automatically installed on every site.</p>\n<p>GoDaddy&#8217;s new offering is aggressively priced at $10/month for one site and ranges to $99/month for 25 sites. Mays said that hosting millions of WordPress sites has allowed GoDaddy to gain economies of scale and pass on the savings to customers. For comparison, WP Engine&#8217;s personal plan <a href=\"https://wpengine.com/plans/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pricing</a> starts at $25/month for one site and $249/month for 25 sites. Flywheel&#8217;s bulk <a href=\"https://getflywheel.com/pricing/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">pricing</a> starts at $92/month for 10 installs and $229/month for up to 30 sites. SiteGround is still somewhat of an outlier with unlimited installs for any of its <a href=\"https://www.siteground.com/wordpress-hosting.htm\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">bulk WordPress hosting plans</a>, which begin at $5.95/month and range to $11.95/month.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Our chief competitors are other hosts who serve Web Pros like WP Engine, SiteGround, and others,&#8221; Mays said. &#8220;We differentiate in performance, quality, and value. For example, while our competitors serve their products from a shared environment, we don’t. Our customers get a fully containerized environment with isolated resources. This delivers high performance and failover for high redundancy.&#8221;</p>\n<p>GoDaddy&#8217;s WordPress customer base continues to outpace the growth of the market. In 2016, roughly one third of all GoDaddy sites were running on WordPress, and half of all new sites were using the software. Over the past several years, GoDaddy has been working to overcome its poor reputation in the WordPress community. During that time, the company acquired several large WordPress-related products to boost its offerings in the space, including ManageWP (<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/godaddy-acquires-wordpress-site-management-service-managewp\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">September 2016</a>), WP Curve (<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/godaddy-acquires-wp-curve-aims-to-become-a-one-stop-shop-for-wordpress-professionals\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">December 2016</a>), and Sucuri (<a href=\"https://wptavern.com/godaddy-acquires-sucuri\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">March 2017)</a>.</p>\n<p>The acquisition of these products, as well as partnerships with Gravity Forms, Beaver Builder, and WP101, were all milestones in what Mays said is GoDaddy&#8217;s goal &#8211; to become &#8220;a one-stop shop for WordPress professionals.” The company continues to invest in the community by sponsoring WordCamps globally and supporting WordPress security team lead Aaron Campbell as a full-time core contributor.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Five years ago, GoDaddy wasn’t involved in the WordPress community; we were the mammoth host that made money off of WordPress without giving back,&#8221; Mays said. &#8220;We’ve made some big strides in changing that, and will continue to ramp up our commitment to the WordPress community.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 21:57:58 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:38:\"HeroPress: Be Brave and Trust Yourself\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2172\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:128:\"https://heropress.com/essays/be-brave-and-trust-yourself/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=be-brave-and-trust-yourself\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11448:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/101717-min-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: Choose to be brave and trust yourself.\" /><h3>Beginnings</h3>\n<p>I was born into a working-class family in Targoviste, a small town in Romania situated around 50 miles from the capital, Bucharest. My childhood was a normal one, mostly happy but marked negatively by the frequent conflicts between my parents.</p>\n<p>Growing up, they didn’t have much to offer to me and my brother. They struggled to give us as much as possible, and at the end, they did offer us quite a decent life, but all those shortages can be quite difficult to understand, especially for a child.</p>\n<p>“Why the other kids can have things that I don’t have?”</p>\n<p>“Why didn’t my parents gave me more?”</p>\n<p>I knew since then, part of the answer. They didn’t give me more because they didn’t have more, not because they didn’t want to. Thinking more about this, years later, I actually realized, that this whole situation was actually more of a blessing for me, and I am now really grateful for it.</p>\n<p>Why I’m saying this?</p>\n<p>Because not having everything gave me an incredible motivation to grow, overcome my situation, be creative and don’t ever give up on my dreams.</p>\n<h3>Facing the world</h3>\n<p>Wanting to do great things with my life, I always knew that staying in my small town forever is not an option.<br />\nSo, at 19, after finishing high school, I got admitted to Politehnica University of Bucharest, to study Computer Science. My brother was the one that convinced me to pursue this subject of study, as I wasn’t very sure on which path I should choose because I was not having enough self-confidence that I would be good at it, even though I always was better at this fields of study in school.</p>\n<p>I have to thank him for that.</p>\n<p>Going to University was by far the most important moment in my life at that time. It was hard but beautiful at the same time, the whole experience. At first, it was a total shock for me. Between all the big changes in my life, like leaving home for the first time, living in a college dorm with three new girls, taking care of myself and all that, school was not that easy anymore either. Even though I always liked studying and was one of the best students in my class, University was at a totally different level.</p>\n<blockquote><p>It was really difficult to adjust, as I started to think again that maybe I wasn’t good enough for this, that it’s not something I can do, and I should give up.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Luckily I didn’t do that, and with lots of work, in time, I managed to adapt and eventually finish the University with both a Bachelor’s degree and Master’s degree in Computer Science.</p>\n<p>From my second year at University, I started thinking seriously that I should start working. I always wanted to have financial independence, as I also knew deep down, how difficult it would be for my parents to sustain me over the course of the next years of study. So, I started to search for jobs. I had so little self-confidence that I thought that nobody will ever hire me, so I took the first job offer that I received.</p>\n<p>I started to work part-time as a junior web developer at a small IT company. Looking back at that time, I can’t say I learned much there, as the company itself and the people in charge of it were not very interested in teaching me something or giving me interesting projects, so I could evolve professionally. And this was not happening just for me. Months later I realized this was their thing. They were mostly hiring students, paying them very small salaries and in some ways taking advantages of them. For example, in my case, they didn’t make me a contract even after 6 months there, even though they promised me that since day one. So, I was working illegally all that time, with no paid taxes, with a salary of just 90$ a month.</p>\n<p>But considering all this, I’m honestly happy I’ve had the chance to work there. I didn’t have the chance to learn much programming there, but I learned other valuable things that helped me through my life. All I’ve experienced that time, gave me a much more sense of what the world really is. And it made me realize that I want more, that I deserve more. There had to be something better out there.</p>\n<p>Plus, there is where I met my fiance <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"?\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n<h3>Finding my way</h3>\n<p>I started to search for a new job and lucky enough, in a couple of days I started working at Codeinwp.com. At that time, it was a really small agency, in a tiny office, with only two other employees besides me. We were all kind of the same age, students with no money, no major work ( or as a matter of fact, even life ) experience but with big ambitions. It was obvious for me, from the start, that this was a very different company than the one where I’ve worked before. I got my contract signed in the first two days, I got payed better, I got interesting projects to work on, I got people helping me learn.</p>\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_1.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-2173\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_1.jpg\" alt=\"Rodica at WordCamp\" width=\"300\" height=\"450\" /></a>WordCamp Europe 2017 Paris, The Afterparty\n<p>And I got something that I didn’t know existed in other companies. I got freedom and trust. Lots of trust.</p>\n<p>The company is co-founded by Ionut Neagu, who was at that moment living in France. And he was running the business from there, miles away from us, not knowing what we’re doing all the time. I don’t think many people would be able to do this. And do it successfully.</p>\n<p>I also think that part of his success in running this business is his way of being, as he is genuinely one of the most generous and kind-hearted people I’ve met. Always there for everyone.</p>\n<h3>The Breakthrough</h3>\n<p>The first couple of years in the company were a bit tough, especially for Ionut, as he had to always find new projects and customers to make sure we are making enough money to sustain us all. At that time, I didn’t realized that, but now I understand how difficult it was for him sometimes, and I appreciate him more.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Here is where I also first encountered WordPress. It was a new concept, not just for me, but for the other guys too. And we started to learn it, step by step, project by project. And it changed our lives.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In 2014, the whole company made a risky change, that proved, in time, to be a great choice. We launched Themeisle.com, a marketplace for our own WordPress themes and plugins, and also launched Zerif Lite, that gradually became one of the most popular themes on the wordpress.org repository. Currently is used by more than 100.000 users.</p>\n<p>The road was not an easy one, but 5 years later, almost 500,000 people in the world are using our products. I still can’t believe that so many people are influenced by something that I’ve done. Always thought that is difficult for a common man to have an impact on the world. But I had an impact too, in my own way.</p>\n<h3>Discovering The World</h3>\n<p>The first time I visited a foreign country was in 2014, at WordCamp Europe in Sofia, Bulgaria. I remember it like yesterday. It was so exciting for me. Though, I don’t think I’ve realized, at that time, the true meaning and dimensions of a WordCamp and all the great things happening in the community. I think I was too amazed of just having the opportunity to travel. But this was not going to stop here.</p>\n<p>We got the chance to travel to all major WordCamps in Europe, and discovered the joy of participating as volunteers too ( and organizers now too).</p>\n<blockquote><p>I’ve met so many great people, from all around the globe, I’ve learned so much from all the different cultures.</p></blockquote>\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_2.jpg\"><img class=\"wp-image-2175 size-medium\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/img_2-300x200.jpg\" alt=\"ThemeIsle Team\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></a>Part of the team at WordCamp Europe 2017\n<p>And last year, I’ve got the chance to go somewhere I’ve never imagine going. We went to New York, and joined WordCamp US in Philadelphia. It was such an amazing experience for which I’m so grateful, and hope everyone can have this kind of opportunities.</p>\n<h3>In Conclusion</h3>\n<p>I’m so proud of being part of the WordPress community and part of the ThemeIsle team. It’s so rewarding to start working in a small company and see it grow, alongside you. To see it flourish, starting from almost nothing and reaching success, after many challenges and obstacles along the way. As cheesy as it may sound, it’s almost like seeing your child grow and fulfill his dreams.</p>\n<p>And as I mostly struggled thinking I wasn’t better enough at the beginning of my life, all these experiences made me realize that you just have to work for your dreams, don’t ever give up, and realize that always, even though somebody will be better than you, you are better than others. It’s important the direction you choose to look at.</p>\n<p>So choose to be brave and trust yourself.</p>\n<div class=\"rtsocial-container rtsocial-container-align-right rtsocial-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-twitter-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Tweet: Be Brave and Trust Yourself\" class=\"rtsocial-twitter-button\" href=\"https://twitter.com/share?text=Be%20Brave%20and%20Trust%20Yourself&via=heropress&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbe-brave-and-trust-yourself%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal fb-light\"><div class=\"rtsocial-fb-horizontal-button\"><a title=\"Like: Be Brave and Trust Yourself\" class=\"rtsocial-fb-button rtsocial-fb-like-light\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbe-brave-and-trust-yourself%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-linkedin-button\" href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?mini=true&url=https%3A%2F%2Fheropress.com%2Fessays%2Fbe-brave-and-trust-yourself%2F&title=Be+Brave+and+Trust+Yourself\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Share: Be Brave and Trust Yourself\"></a></div></div><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal\"><div class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-horizontal-button\"><a class=\"rtsocial-pinterest-button\" href=\"https://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https://heropress.com/essays/be-brave-and-trust-yourself/&media=https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/101717-min-150x150.jpg&description=Be Brave and Trust Yourself\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Pin: Be Brave and Trust Yourself\"></a></div></div><a rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"perma-link\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/be-brave-and-trust-yourself/\" title=\"Be Brave and Trust Yourself\"></a></div><p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/be-brave-and-trust-yourself/\">Be Brave and Trust Yourself</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 18 Oct 2017 05:00:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:17:\"Rodica Andronache\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"WPTavern: Medium Opens Partner Program, Allows Anyone to Publish Behind Its $5 Paywall\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=75602\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"https://wptavern.com/medium-opens-partner-program-allows-anyone-to-publish-behind-its-5-paywall\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11215:\"<p>In March 2017, Medium <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/medium-aims-to-fix-broken-media-with-new-5-subscription-program\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">scrapped its previous ad-driven revenue model</a> to become a publisher of premium, subscription-based content. The company launched a new $5 subscription program and gave a select group of writers and publications the ability to publish articles behind a paywall inside its network. Medium&#8217;s invitation-only Partner Program <a href=\"https://blog.medium.com/expanding-the-medium-partner-program-3be09dd146e4\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">launched in August</a> but has now been expanded to include any author or publisher who wants to publish behind the paywall.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Starting today, anyone can enroll in our Partner Program and earn money based on the depth and value they provide to members, not the fleeting attention they deliver to advertisers,&#8221; Medium CEO Ev Williams said. &#8220;Along with that, we add stories from the world’s best publishers and seamlessly combine it all in an ad-free, personalized experience. The end goal is to offer the world&#8217;s best source for important stories and ideas.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Authors are rewarded based on engagement with their posts, as measured by the number of &#8220;clap&#8221; reactions a post receives via the network&#8217;s new <a href=\"https://blog.medium.com/show-authors-more-%EF%B8%8F-with-s-c1652279ba01\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">applause button</a>. Readers can clap multiple times and the system evaluates claps on a per-user basis, tracking the number of claps a reader assigns relative to the number of claps that individual typically sends. Subscribers will have their membership fees allocated to different authors based the claps they have given to posts behind the paywall.</p>\n<p>Medium quickly changed its &#8220;no access&#8221; paywall to a &#8220;metered&#8221; one after launching with a small group of publishers. This means that members can still read a limited number of locked stories each month before hitting the wall. The idea behind this move, according to Sam Duboff, Medium&#8217;s head of product marketing, is to give paywalled posts exposure to a wider audience while still paying content creators, instead of having articles simply get buried due to lack of exposure.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">with our metered paywall, we\'re hoping to enable both reach &amp; $$. also lots of great writers haven\'t joined b/c they can be paid elsewhere.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Sam Duboff (@duboff) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/duboff/status/909849467859345408?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 18, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Perhaps, but note the paywall is (now) metered, a la NYT, so free readers can still access (w/login)</p>\n<p>&mdash; Ev Williams (@ev) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ev/status/900067262031290368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 22, 2017</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Some authors have posted publicly about their earnings and Medium representatives told <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2017/10/10/medium-opens-up-its-partner-program-allowing-anyone-to-publish-behind-its-paywall/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">TechCrunch</a> that 83% of those who published paywalled stories received payments during the month of September with payments averaging $93.65.

After failing to find success with this model, Medium has repackaged itself as a publisher of subscription-based content and aims to throw a wide net by calling its partner program &#8220;<a href=\"http://medium.com/creators\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the internet’s first open paywall</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;And while many publishers are looking towards subscriptions as an alternative to the deleterious effects of ads (a move we support for everyone), Medium is the only &#8216;open paywall&#8217; for thoughtful content on the internet,&#8221; Williams said. &#8220;Which means, we tap into the ideas and expertise of thousands of the smartest minds on the planet — many of whom made Medium what it is today — to bring fresh perspectives to Medium members.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite setting out to create “a different, bolder approach,” as Williams called it earlier this year, the company has landed on a cheap paywall that is open to any content creator. Putting content behind a paywall isn&#8217;t a good strategy for individuals or businesses that depend on their products and ideas getting maximum exposure. It&#8217;s also <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/publishers-are-moving-back-to-wordpress-after-short-experiments-with-medium\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">not a sustainable model for larger publishers</a>, several of which Medium had wooed to its platform before suddenly shifting its business strategy.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Our medium publication gets a ton of traffic, but feels shitty to paywall it to make $12 bucks.

There is a lot we need to figure out to make this work right. But we are convinced that by joining forces, we can make a new economic model for quality content.

Gutenberg&#8217;s current design trajectory doesn&#8217;t seem to be putting it on track for delivering the minimalist writing environment that many writers crave. The project has a lot of publishing and design-related functionality to account for in its UI, but I am hopeful that the plugin ecosystem will offer extensions that pare Gutenberg back to just the essentials for writing.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, those in search of a minimalist writing experience have found it in dedicated writing apps like iA Writer, Ulysses, WriteRoom, OmmWriter, and others. The <a href=\"http://www.bear-writer.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Bear app</a>, a newcomer launched in 2016, is a rising favorite that works on iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Although somewhat better known as a note-taking app, Bear&#8217;s beautiful writing experience won the app a <a href=\"https://blog.bear-writer.com/thank-you-yes-you-for-our-2017-apple-design-award-1b13e702ee91\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">2017 Apple Design Award</a>.</p>\n<p>Bear blends the best features of a note-taking app with a writing app. Users can turn on Focus Mode using the bottom right icon, which hides the sidebar and note list to provide a more minimal writing space. Bear saves users&#8217; writing in real-time, offers in-line support for images, and syntax highlighting for 20+ programming languages. There are no distractions while the user is composing, as the editor instantly displays rich previews. It&#8217;s easy to see why Bear has become an instant favorite.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-10-13-at-12.29.28-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Many Bear users still have the need to publish their writings to the web, a capability that the app doesn&#8217;t currently support. Naturally, a WordPress export or &#8220;Publish to WordPress&#8221; option is one of the most often requested features. However, <a href=\"http://www.shinyfrog.net/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Shiny Frog</a>, the company behind the Bear app, is not yet working on publishing features.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Medium and WordPress publishing features are on our todo list, but not on top priority right now,&#8221; Shiny Frog co-founder Danilo Bonardi <a href=\"http://help.shinyfrog.net/discussions/bear/2477-export-to-wordpress\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> when I asked last November about the company&#8217;s plans to support a WordPress export option.</p>\n<p>Other users have also posted to the app&#8217;s <a href=\"http://help.shinyfrog.net/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">support forum</a> and its <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bearapp/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">subreddit</a>, asking for WordPress integration:</p>\n<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m really enjoying using Bear for my writing, and the newer features are great, but I&#8217;m trying to get started with my own blog and more as I am developing my own business and being able to export to WordPress would be incredibly helpful for me going forward.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>This is the one feature that would allow me to switch from Ulysses.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>With Ulysses going to a (more expensive) subscription, the time seems right for Bear to offer a &#8220;publish to WordPress&#8221; feature that could match what Ulysses offers. This is about the only thing holding Bear back for me.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m currently deciding between Bear and Ulysses, and right now the dealbreaker is Ulysses&#8217;s ability to push to WordPress. If you were able to build that functionality, it would seal the deal!</p></blockquote>\n<p>Bonardi <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/bearapp/comments/6z9qum/feature_request_medium_integration/dmurk7m/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">confirmed</a> again, as recently as last month, that the company is still keeping a tight focus and has not yet prioritized publishing to WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Publishing features have been asked before and we will address them sooner or later,&#8221; Bonardi said. &#8220;Our hopes are to integrate Bear with Medium/WordPress apps instead of implementing our own publishing tool with their APIs. Using their APIs is the other solution but in this scenario we have to build a specific UI for this functionality instead of relying on external apps.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In the meantime, Bear App support staff recommends using the Markdown export option, available in the free version. Additional export options, including HTML, are available Bear&#8217;s $14.99 per year Pro version, which is much more affordable than pricey competitors like <a href=\"https://ulyssesapp.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Ulysses</a> and others that cater specifically to long-form writing.</p>\n<p>Quadro also has an <a href=\"https://www.quadro.me/themes/unleash-the-bear\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">option to share Bear notes to both Medium and WordPress</a>. However, it&#8217;s not an official Bear utility and the workflow is rather complicated to set up. Users who have tried this option didn&#8217;t find it to save time over simply copying and pasting.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Needs Its Own Beautiful Writing Experience</h3>\n<p>WordPress publishing support for Bear doesn&#8217;t seem to be a major priority for the company at this time, but splitting up the writing and publishing process is a deal breaker for many who want a simple workflow that doesn’t involve copying and pasting between apps.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, what if WordPress could be known for its beautiful writing experience in core, without a user having to resort to plugins or third-party apps to get there? This seems like a reasonable expectation for Gutenberg, but the project has the added challenge of incorporating a lot of publishing, media, and legacy functionality into its UI in a way that is easily discoverable.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this has resulted in an interface that is constantly popping into view. With the right combination of clicks and hovers, a user can end up in situation like the one shown below in the screenshot &#8211; surrounded by formatting options and icons on all sides.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Screen-Shot-2017-10-13-at-1.22.21-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>Making it easy to publish to the web, which is WordPress&#8217; forte, isn&#8217;t as compelling if users have to look elsewhere to find a truly distraction-free writing experience.  Fortunately, minimalist writing apps like Bear can fill the gap until the WordPress plugin ecosystem can produce an interface where writing is a delight.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 13 Oct 2017 22:17:43 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"WPTavern: WordPress 4.9 Protects Users From Fatal Errors Created in the Theme and Plugin Editors\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=75725\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:107:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-9-protects-users-from-fatal-errors-created-in-the-theme-and-plugin-editors\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1923:\"<p>Over the years, there have been many discussions and debates on whether or not WordPress should have a built-in file editor for themes and plugins. The file editors, while convenient, allow users to easily trigger fatal errors that can be difficult to fix, especially if they don&#8217;t have FTP access.</p>\n<p>Instead of removing the editors from core, the WordPress development team has enhanced them by adding fatal error protection in WordPress 4.9. When a user accesses the theme or plugin editor for the first time, they&#8217;re presented with the following warnings. The warnings are a result of a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/31779\">three-year-old trac ticket</a>.</p>\n<img />Plugin Editor Warning\n<img />Theme Editor Warning\n<p>If you try to save changes to a file and WordPress detects a fatal error, the change is not saved and a warning message is displayed that explains where the error occurred. Although the changes are rolled back, the code in the editor is not replaced with the original. To replace the code, simply refresh the browser tab.</p>\n<img />Fatal Error Detected\n<p>In addition to safety features, the code editors are powered by <a href=\"https://codemirror.net/\">CodeMirror</a>, an open-source, JavaScript powered text editor that adds features such as line numbers. The plugin editor includes the ability to look up documentation for filters, hooks, and actions with many of the links pointing to the new <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/\">WordPress Developers Resource</a> site.</p>\n<p>Even with the addition of CodeMirror in core, the file editors in WordPress are not a replacement for an integrated development environment.

Below is a screenshot of <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/network/dependencies\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Gutenberg&#8217;s dependency graph</a>:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-12-at-11.30.42-AM-e1507825905511.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>GitHub plans to extend dependency graphs to show security alerts when one of the dependencies is using a version that is publicly known to be vulnerable to a security issue. The alerts may also in some cases be able to suggest a security fix. Security alerts for dependencies is the first among a collection of security tools that GitHub has planned to release.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/dependency-graph.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>The dependency graph isn&#8217;t yet as useful as it could be for many PHP-based WordPress projects, but GitHub&#8217;s decision to start with support for JavaScript and Ruby dependencies is in line with the data the company collected from repositories. JavaScript and Ruby are among the top four most popular languages on GitHub, as measured by the number of pull requests. JavaScript is by far the most popular and PHP isn&#8217;t too far behind Ruby, according to stats from the <a href=\"https://octoverse.github.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">State of the Octoverse 2017</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-12-at-12.35.41-PM-e1507830673184.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>GitHub is also launching new efforts to connect its massive community. The company reported 24 million developers working across 67 million repositories in 2017. The new community features are aimed at helping developers make meaningful connections in the vast sea of repositories on the platform. Users will notice a new “Discover Repositories” feed in their dashboards that makes recommendations based on their starred repositories and the people they follow.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Screen-Shot-2017-10-12-at-12.15.45-PM.png?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>GitHub has also launched a new curated <a href=\"https://github.com/explore\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Explore</a> section to help users browse open source projects, topics, events, and resources.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 12 Oct 2017 18:56:34 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 4.9 Beta 2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=4946\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2017/10/wordpress-4-9-beta-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1626:\"<p>WordPress 4.9 Beta 2 is now available!</p>\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site.
